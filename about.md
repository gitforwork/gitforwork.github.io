This site is created to help the larger immigrant community by curating individual immigrant experiences!

This site is created by me, Pattam Onnu. Few years ago I came to USA as an international student. Currently, I am working in the Software industry. This blog is to document my experiences accumulated through my journey so far! 
Broadly, I would be writing about the following topics from an immigrant perspective, 
* Visa (H2b, L1, F1 etc) 
* Green card 
* Carrier (mostly in the Software Industry) 
* Job search 
* Finance, Money, Frugality 

If you have a story to share, I am happy to hear!.
