This site is created by Pattam, to help other fellow immigrants in the land of opportunities, USA!
Came here as a student, graduated right into the middle of the great recession! Managed to land jobs in spite of the bad markets. 
Currently, working in the software industry, continuing on the eventful journey of life. Along the way done many things right, many things wrong. Accumulated many experiences around studying in the US, career in the US and visa situations etc. This blog is to share all those experiences faced by us and our friends.  

I am planning to write about every day visa issues, career choices and other general topics that I come across or learn through my  friends.
