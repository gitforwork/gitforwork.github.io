This site is created to help the larger immigrant community by curating individual immigrant experiences!

This site is created by me, Pattam Onnu. Few years ago I came to USA as an international student. Currently, I am working in the Software industry. This blog is to document my experiences accumulated through my journey so far!.  
 Broadly, I would be writing about the following topics from an immigrant perspective, 

 * Visa (H1b, L1 etc) 
 * Green card - Employment based (Eb1, Eb2, Eb3, Eb5 etc)
 
 If you have a story to share, I am happy to hear!.
