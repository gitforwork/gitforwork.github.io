description: How to pass the Professional Scrum Master (PSM I) Certification
---
Finally, I got myself certified a Professional Scrum Master (PSM I)!. I have been in agile project development
environments for a few years now. I have also played the Scrum Master role without completely understanding the Scrum framework.
 So, I decided to formalize my Scrum knowledge and decided to get myself certified.

 <<certification goes here>>

 The exam costs $150. Once you pay the fee, you would be emailed a passcode to take the online test. This passcode never expires.
 But only good for one attempt. You would have to score 85% in a 80 question test. The philosophy of scrum.org is "Cheap and Hard".
 So, it needs a fair amount of preparation to pass. In the end, I was happy that my efforts paid off. I passed with 98% in my first attempt.

Here are my steps that helped my get my PSM I certification.

  1. It took me about 2-3 weeks to get the certification
  2. You should go through the Scrumguide. It's just a 16 page document, but you really have to digest the essence of Scrum
  3. Take the scrum open assessments. There are 4, focus on PSPO. PSD is not needed. eloborate
  4. Learn about the basics of scaling scrum (Nexus guide).
  5. Finally, I have created a full length practise test <<here>>. Hopefully that helps you
  6.


I took the exam online. Once you buy the exam on the site, you get a code in an email shortly.
This passcode is valid for one test, but doesn't expire.

I don't know if you have options other than online exam.

1) In total I prepared for 2-3 weeks.

2) I studied and restudied the scrum guide carefully until I digested the information.
Even though the scrumguide is short, each sentence has to be understood and remembered.

3) I took the open assessment once everyday. it's necessary to score 100% in the open assessment, but definitely not sufficient.

4) Sample tests
I took the green mirage test,

and the mlapshin one

5) While I was consistently scoring well on the open assessment, in these tests I don't do well. That was an eye opener to me. It showed me, where I was lacking. So repeated the process 2-4 until I got better.

6) I also gave a 1-2 days gap with these sample tests, so that I don't remember the answers from the last time and don't just answer mechanically.

7) The actual exam itself was not bad. But it was a bit involved. May questions were describing real scenarios and force you to think about the information you get from the scrum guide. Needs you to keep focused. I was able to complete the exam in 45 minutes. Overall not bad.

8) You can mark the question for review and revisit in the end if you wish to. That's a convenience.

Overall a good exam where have a wonderful opportunity to learn about scrum. Let me know if you have questions. And good luck!
