description: Thinking about long term market returns of s&p 500
---

Long term stock returns of s&p 500 index is said to be approximately 10%.
Its also said that on a longer term stock returns roughly tracks the underlying business economics.
Therefore, return on equity of a spc is also 10%.
This 10% remains consistent across decades, that means it has to keep up with the forces of inflation.
ie the company has to grow earnings at least to the extent of lost value of money,
to keep up with its 10% returns. Google tells me long term inflation in the US is around 3.5%.

So here are the characteristics of a spc company,
ROE:10%; growth:3.5%;

Market values such a company with a p/e of around trailing 12 months 15, the long term average p/e of spc.
So, if someone invests in a company whose p/e is 15. In the next 12 months, earnings yield is expected to be
(1/15) = 6.6%. Adding the 3.5% earnings growth, we achieve a return of 10%.
p/(e(1+.035g))=15; p = 15*e(1+.035g)
If we are not index investing if we want to grow our money faster than spc,
Our goal is to buy a company that has higher ROE/ROIC (companies with debt), growing at a greater clip than 3.5%.
It doesn't end there. Remember the 10% is an average return. In real life, spc sticks with the companies through good times and bad times. That means hold the company for ever as long as their characteristics are in tact.
Well, if you have decided to hold a company for ever, first of all the company should survive for that long which means,
                1)            It should provide a product/service that is valuable for the society for a long term.
                2)            It should be able to price for its goods to sustain over the long term.
                3)            Management committed to keep intact the above 2 for the long term.

How much to pay for such a business?
It seems to me that, price doesn't matter much if the above are true. Remember spc doesn't worry about price. It is worried about earnings. As earnings grow it bulks up on the stock.
Perhaps, it is important to focus on the attention on the operational traits than on valuation?
The most preferred method is to pay equal to or less than spc. That means a p/e under 15 for a company observably better than spc.

But if the position is reversed, would you be willing to sell your better-than-spc company for spc price. Nope.
So it seems to me that price doesn't mthink its ok to pay a premium. May be use something like a PEG ratio. Remember spc doesn't care about price. infact it buys more as the earnings become better.

Market already assigns an earnings multiple for a stock. Its seems that as long as the above characteristics hold good, the market most probably will value the company at the same multiple to earnings.
So price doesn't matter. However, its essential to pay less than the fair value, to account for we as a value investor want to pay less than the market valuation.

Whenever the valuation fluctuates below its average without any change in long term fundamentals, that when to buy.

Other important to also remember that spc
is always diversified with 500 companies (individual investors cannot mimic this)
rarely changes the portfolio. But rebalances constantly to favour bulking up companies.
