"Free cash flow per share over the difficult past five years grew 7% per year, coming in at around $1.25 per share for the fiscal year ending in September.
If we assume the company continues on its path in terms of customer and asset growth, that the interest rate compression of the past five years goes away, and
that shares continue to be repurchased at 3-4% per year, we expect per-share free cash flow growth to be in the low-teens.
If we get lucky and the company makes a better spread on the float, that could result over the next five years in 20-25% annual free-cash-flow growth. If we can
pay only a 12.3x multiple for that, we think the math will work very much in our favor"

Inferences:
1) He talks about free cash flow here and not book value or earnings, especially for a financial company
2) He talks about free cash flow per share and not the enterprise
3) He looks at the free cash flow growth for the last 5 years
4) He estimates free cash flow growth to be in low teens (13-14%). How does he arrive at that?
      a) Assumes the past 7% growth to continue. Doesn't look sophisticated to me. Seems to be a simple assumption based on recovery from 2008.
      b) Share repurchases is assumed to give 4% at the upper end
      c) Rest comes from interest rate compression. So roughly if 11% come from above 2, he expects 2-3% from interest rate decompression.
5) He also talks about 20-25% annual free cash flow growth on a better spread on the float. not sure if this is how a better float gives additional 10%
6) Valuation he talks about in terms of multiple. 12.3x

Fact checks:
7% 5 year free cash flow growth. which one? owner earnings or plain free cash flow? Mentions 1.25$ per share that should give some clue.
From Sep 6 to Sep 11, free cash flow per share grew from 0.88 to 1.11.  Not sure from where he gets the 1.25$ figure. This is not a simple free cash flow.
 Most likely some form of owner earnings. Assuming 0.88 as owner earnings and taking his 1.25$, then cagr over 5% matches his 7% figure.

12.3x multiple of what is he talking about?
At 15.41$ per share as mentioned from his document, at 1.25$ free cash flow, his 12.3x estimate indeed matches.

What was the ROE, ROIC, ROE at the time he was talking about?
ROE is in mid teens since the recession, but before that it was over 30s.
ROA is very low in the range of 2-3% throughout.
ROIC is again in low teens since recession, before that in the 20s.
ROIC- GB is in triple digits. probably some issues. May be because of financial company

When did he sell? How did it turn out?

Next, MARKEL (MKL)
"As I look out at the opportunity for Markel over the next 5 to 10 years, I believe book value ought to be compounding at a mid-teens level.
 Book value today is $330 per share, so you’re paying around 125% of book. That is hardly expensive for a high-quality, well-run and transparent insurance
 company that I believe can compound book value at 15% annually. As I mentioned earlier, 200% to 300% of book is not at all out of line for this type of company
 in a different part of the cycle. If I’m right on growth, book value in the next two years increases to $435 per share. Even if the multiple stays the same,
 I have an attractive return. But when the market hardens, the impact should be even more exciting"

Inferences:
He talks about book value here, Markel being a financial company.
He again talks about per share book value
He predicts 15% growth for next 5- 10 years. From where is this 15% going to come from?
  He talks about recovering from soft insurance market. He mentioned earlier that last 5 years Markel's compounded book value growth to be
   at 9-12%. He calculates that gear ratio used to be 4:1. So every 1$ book value had 4$ investment. So if they make 5% returns on the investments that is magnified
   to 4x5 = 20% of book value. This seems to be excellent use of operational leverage. Because of the soft market their gear ratio currently is at 2.5:1.
   Hence the compounded returns in the 9-12% range (2.5*5%). Here I think Akre doesn't seem to think about where new growth will come from, just thinks
    about recovery in pricing contributing positively to the results.
He also mentions about market valuing such a business at 200% to 300% of book. So he does talk about how market will value a business rather than whats is the value of the
business to a private owner.
He also seems to think in terms of multiple. "multiple stays the same". He seems to think about exit multiple.

Fact checks:
Book value is 330$ per share. 125% book. He also expects book value to increase to 435$ in next 2 years. What book value is he talking about?
Book, Tangible Books are 350$ and 261$ respectively. So he most likely looks at simple book value.
414.25$ price as mentioned in the document, price to book is 1.18 pretty close to his 125%. So looks like he indeed looks at simple book value.
He mentions 15% compounded rate in next 2 years will make the book to 435$, again simple book value.

Enstar (ESGR):
Inferences:
Mentions about past 6 years compounded growth at 20%
Mentions again about per share book
He mentions that it can compound at mid teens compounding going forward. not sure how he arrives at that.
Here again he seems to think about 2 year multiple. possible multiple expansion. Doesn't seem to think about multiple contraction
At 15% expected growth he seems to think that, current price is less than next year 2012 book value.
Here again he talks about what the market can price the stock at not about the value to the private owners.

Fact check:
At 98.70$ stock price, he says it trades less than 140% book. Check for which book value again.
