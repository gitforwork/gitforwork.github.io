Valuing a stock in its simplest form can be compared to a rental property purchase.
Here is the core concept explained with a simplified example,

Fixed Deposit (FD) or CD or Term deposit offered by a bank is the first preference for many people for investment.
For example, currently banks advertise 5% interest for a term deposit of 10+ or more years.
Banks also guarantee the principal and interest through some arrangement with the government.
Hence this is an easiest and risk free investment.

How does it work? Lets say you invest a principal amount of 10000$ in a 10 year term deposit.
You get an interest of 5%*10000 = 500$ every year for 10 years and at the end of 10 years you get the principal back. Hold on to the thought for now.
Lets move on to buying a house/apartment as an investment. Lets say you currently you have an option to buy an apartment that brings in 1000$ in rent per month.
Convert the monthly rent to yearly income. 1000*12 = 12000$. We can expect some maintenance expenses like property tax, security, repairs etc.
Lets assume those come to about 2000$ in total per year. So our yearly net income from the property is 12000-2000 = 10000$.
So we as a owner can pocket 10000$ out of the house every year. Lets call this owner earnings.

How much to pay for the property that would bring a FD like returns? i.e, if 10000$ is the yearly interest at assumed 5% rate, what would be the principal?
Its a reverse of our FD interest calculation. Here we know the interest amount and we expect a 5% interest rate, but principal is the unknown.
Doing the math, principal would be (10000/5%) = 200,000$. So the fair value to pay for the property is 200,000$ if we want to generate FD like returns. However what about the risk?
While FD is a risk free, rental property is not.

What are the possible risks? We assumed the house will always earn about 12000$ per year. What if the house didn't wasn't occupied for a couple of months?
 What if the house needed more than expected repairs in a year? If the property is closer to the airport, the govt can take over the land for expansion.
 This might result in permanent loss of capital. While these are not likely to happen, but they are potential risks.
 To compensate for more risk, its fair to expect more returns than a FD.

How much more? As a margin of safety lets assume we want atleast double of FD returns. so if FD returns 5% we want 10% returns on the rental property. Doing the math again,
(10000/10%) = 100,000$. So you should pay no more than 100,000$ for a satisfactory return. But practically, neighbourhood might be expensive. Other similar houses might have sold for higher prices.
That probably means the market is expensive. However, if you and your family are very keen to live in the neighbourhood, you may consider paying up because you value the higher quality of life. While it doesn't make sense as an investment but it may make sense as a personal value.

The same concept can be applied to valuing a stock. stock is the fractional ownership of a company. companies generate revenue through sales.
After expenses like buying property, plants, equipments, marketing, R&D, salary etc, what you get is owner earnings.
With expected rate returns for assuming more risks than a FD, we should be able to arrive at a fair value for a stock.
Like an expensive neighbourhood, stocks may not be available for that price. But time to time, stocks sell for cheap. The trick is to wait patiently for that time.

Can the same concept be applied to all investments? Nope. what about a car? car doesn't produce anything.
It's price depend on the perceived valued to the buyer. Same goes for art and most famous of  all Gold!.
Buying gold ornaments and coins during cultural events like weddings may bring happiness and hence valuable.
But, in itself gold doesn't produce any earnings. Future price of gold depends on the perceived value of the buyer.
So, as an investment, gold is not a good choice.
