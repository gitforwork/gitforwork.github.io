5 ways to get yourself hurt in the H1b race

1) Missing the deadline for the lottery
Usually, USCIS starts accepting the new H1b visa petitions starting in April. And USCIS continues the accept petitions until the cap is 
reached. However, in the last few years the cap is reached very quickly and USCIS resorts to computer generated random lottery. So, if 
your employers petition doesn't reach USCIS by appropriate time you will be left out of the lottery. Hence, it's paramount to send the 
petition package to USCIS right on time. And applying for a new petition needs a few weeks of lead time to prepare the case and file LCA 
etc. So, followup with your employer and keep in touch with the HR/Immigration teams through out. This is especially true if the 
sponsoring employer is not used to filing new H1b visas. And the risk with bigger companies who apply for many employees, it's easy 
to miss an individual. So either ways be on top of the process. Ofcourse, be couteous!

2) Applying multiple petitions through the Employer and it's affiliated companies
As stated above with lottery becoming the norm, some people try to increase their chances by applying more than once. USCIS in 
general doesn't prevent multiple petitions. However, there are caveats. If the same employer applies multiple petitions for you, 
both will be rejected. And USCIS also doesn't like if an Employer and it's affiliates file for the same candidate. So, if you are 
thinking of increasing your chances by getting mltiple employers file for you be careful to get into this sticky situation. 

3) Apply multiple petitions for the same end client project through different employers
This is another special case of multiple petitions specially with the so called "EVC" aka IT consulting model. If totally different 
employers file the petition for the same employee and for the same end client role then expect more scrutiny and rejecttion from USCIS

4) Paying the H1b fees yourself
Your employer is the one who should pay your H1b fees. But if your sponsoring employer insists that you do, then you may want to stay 
away from such employers. If USCIS finds out that the fee came from your pocket then you will be in trouble. However, if you want to upgrade your petition to premium processing, it's ok for the employee to pay the 
premium fee.  

5) Employer’s failure to Meet Requirements
This is one of the common reasons for H1b rejection. Your employer should have legitimate business, tax filings and the ability to pay 
you etc. And they should be able to prove it fair and square when USCIS asks for. Do a thorough analysis of your employer's past 
H1b success/failure rates etc. Use http://redbus2us.com/h1b-visa-sponsors/ for an employers past H1b history. 
But remember, not all employers who have never applied for H1b in the past are bad. There are many good small, medium scale companies 
and startups that never had to apply in the past. As long as they are a viable business with long term prospects you should be ok. 
However, you may have to be more actively involved with them throughout the H1b process.

So, if you are new to the H1b process, educate yourself about the process to avoid unnecessary trouble.
