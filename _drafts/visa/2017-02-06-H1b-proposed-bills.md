4) Trump's executive order

Since the recent presedential elections, immigration issues including the H1b visa program have come under scrutiny. 
There was the executive order and then new bills are being proposed to the congress. It's in a transient state, and this page is to track all the latest developments around the H1b visa program.  This page will also track employment based legal immigration bills that affects H1b employees.

 A quick primer on the bill process in congress. Introduction of the bill is just the first step. It has to go through multiple and lengthier steps before it becomes a law. So, here are the bills introduced so far,

#### Protect and Grow American Jobs Act (HR 170) - Darrel Issa - California
- H1b dependent employers (15% or more employees are H1b) have to pay atleast $100K a year for hiring a new H1b employee
- Current law stipulates that Employers must pay atleast $60K a year, when hiring a master's degree employee. Eliminates this exemption

#### H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act - Republican Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Democrat Richard Durbin (Illinois)
- Employers with 50% or more employees on H1b or L1 visa are not allowed to hire additional H1b workers
- Small employers with under 50 employees are exempted from the above rule
- Placing a H1b worker at a worksite should not replace or adversely affect a similiarly employed American worker at the site. This includes workers placed through other employers too
- Increase law enforcement mechanisms for the Department of Labor
- Eliminates the current practise of random lottery when allocating new H1b. Replace it with merit based preference system. Such a system prefers foreign students educated in the US, advanced degree holders, those with high salary and those with high skills
- Introduce a minimum salary requirement for L1 visa employees
- Redefine the critieria for issuing a L1 visa to allow only truly key employees

#### High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017 - Zoe Lofgren - California
- H1b dependent employers (15% or more employees are H1b) have to pay atleast $130K a year for hiring a new H1b employee
- 20% H1b visas reserved for small startup employers with less than 50 employees
- Replace the current H1b random lottery and award based on the order of salaries, starting from the highest. 
- Eliminate country cap: Employment based immigrant visas should be allocated to the more skilled worker regardless of country of origin. This ensures fairness to H1b worker by enabling them to change jobs and negotiate salary etc. Thus preventing any artificial wage depression caused in the market
- Remove visa hurdles for US educated foregin students to apply for permanent residency

#### Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2017 - Jason Chaffetz - Utah
- Eliminates the country cap for the employment based immigrant visas. This stops the H1b worker's dependency on the employer, there by ensuring easy job mobility and balanced job market. 
- Employees from a single country cannot exceed 85% of total visas issued in a year

#### Trump executive order
