#### Protect and Grow American Jobs Act (HR 170) - Darrel Issa - California
- H1b dependent employers (15% or more employees are H1b) have to pay atleast $100K a year for hiring a new H1b employee
- Current law stipulates that Employers must pay atleast $60K a year, when hiring a master's degree employee. Eliminates this exemption

#### H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act - Republican Chuck Grassley (Iowa) and Democrat Richard Durbin (Illinois)
- Employers with 50% or more employees on H1b or L1 visa are not allowed to hire additional H1b workers
- Small companies with under 50 employees are exempted from the above rule
- Placing a H1b worker at a worksite should not replace or adversely affect a similiarly employed American worker at the site. This includes workers placed through other employers too
- Increase law enforcement mechanisms for the Department of Labor
- Eliminates the current practise of random lottery when allocating new H1b. Replace it with merit based preference system. Such a system prefers foreign students educated in the US, advanced degree holders, those with high salary and those with high skills
- Introduce a minimum salary requirement for L1 visa employees
- Redefine the critieria for issuing a L1 visa to allow only truly key employees

#### High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017 - Zoe Lofgren - California
- 20% visas for startups with less than 50 employees
- Minimum pay to $130K for dependent employees

#### HR370 - 
- Eliminates country quota, to end decade long wait for getting a green card.
- Long wait times for green card makes the employee dependent on the employer, giving the employer more leverage

#### HR370 - Trump executive order

#### New Kid working on a bill
