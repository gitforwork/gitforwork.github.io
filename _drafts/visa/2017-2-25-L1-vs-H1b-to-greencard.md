description: L1 vs H1b - path to green card. L1A advantages over H1b

This is part 2 of our H1b vs L1 visa comparison. [H1b vs L1](/posts/H1b-vs-L1-infographic/) part 1 for more details.

Both H1b and L1 visa are temporary non-immigrant visas. But people entering the U.S. can then apply for permanent residency (green card). However, H1b to green card can be very different from L1 to green card.

L1 visa holders and H1b visa holders have a couple of options to acquiring a permanent residency (green card) through their employers.
Employers of H1b visa holders typically apply green card through employment based permanent visa categories 2 and 3, commonly referred to as Eb2 and Eb3 respectively. L1 visa internally have 2 sub-categories L1A and L1B. L1B typically follow the same options as H1b visa  holders. i.e., applying through the employers for Eb2 or Eb3. And L1A in some cases apply for Eb2 and Eb3. But in some cases their employers apply for them in Employment category 1, commonly referred to as Eb1C. People who qualify as international managers typically go through Eb1C. So, the primary path is Eb2/Eb3 or Eb1C. There are other Eb1 categories, but the qualification for those positions are very high and few people actually qualify.

The difference between these categories are significantly different in terms of the process and also the time duration. In both Eb2 and Eb3 categories, the employers have to follow a long process to prove that the positions that are being filled by foreign nationals could not be filled by American workers. This is proved by ensuring a salary according to the prevailing job market is paid and also recruitment process that run over a few months to try to hire a U.S. worker. Eb1C process skips all these steps and hence more quicker. That's the reason the demand has also increased in recent years. For example, Eb1C visas issues to Indians has doubled in the last 2 years compared to years prior.
