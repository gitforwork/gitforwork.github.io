Part-1

 - Prevailing market wage test - waived
 - Hire American first - waived
 - Wait in line - none
 - Job requirement american standards - none
 - Eb1c comparison numbers for india
 - degree/experience: Masters or Bachelors with 5+ for category 2.  
 - Graphical representation
 
 Graph can be crisper. But details can be more comprehensive
 
 Attribute  | H1b to Eb2/Eb3    | L1A to Eb1c
---------- | ------ | ------
Prevailing wage determination| Sponsoring Employer should get approval from Dept. of Labor (DOL) on the salary to be paid to the foreign national. DOL verifies that the foreign worker wage and working conditions are similiar to comparably employed U.S. workers    |Waived
Hire a U.S. worker: Advertisements| The employer is required to advertise the job on it's own website, newspaper ads and DOL's job bank | Waived
Hire a U.S. worker: Quiet period| The employer should try to recruit a U.S. worker for the advertised position atleast for 60 days. The resumes received, interviews conduted should be clearly documented| Waived
Minimum wage|Must pay at least the minimum prevailing wage in the market|No minimum
Education| US bachelors or equivalent matching the area of work|No minimum education required, as long as the worker has certain special skills
Dependents work permit | Not allowed | Spouses are allowed to work from day one
Blanket petition|Not allowed. Each worker's petition must be individually approved | Companies can get certain number of petitions approved as a blanket and flexible to bring any temporary worker as needed using the blanket category. No need to apply to USCIS for each individual case, saving processing times
Permanent residency| Employers must conduct a labor market test to hire a US citizen and upon passing the worker then has to wait his/her turn in the queue according to his/her country of birth | L1A workers can apply in Eb1C category, which requires no US labor market test. Usually can get green card under a year. L1B visa holder process is similiar to H1b

It looks to me in every category above, L1 is more flexible than the H1b visa.
