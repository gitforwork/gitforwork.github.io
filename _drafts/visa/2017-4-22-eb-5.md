description: EB 5 Investor visa - 2017 Executive Summary.
---
EB-5 visa is a visa category which allows foreign nationals obtain permanent residency (green card) by making investments in a US business. EB-5 visa recipients (foreign nationals and their families) can permanently live and work in the U.S, with a path to U.S. citizenship. 

The program administered by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), was primarily created to create jobs through capital investment from foreign investors.

## EB 5 financing

* Foreign investor has to invest $1 million in a new commercial enterprise **OR**
 
* $500,000 if the investment is in a “Targeted Employment Area (TEA)” defined to include certain rural areas and areas of high unemployment
* The investment should be expected to create at least 10 full-time jobs

* The project must be located in the U.S. and should be a commercial enterprise. 
* Non-commercial investments like personal residence does not count towards EB-5.

#### Targeted Employment Areas
Targeted Employment Area (TEA) is defined by USCIS. Roughly at the time of investment, a rural area outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) or an area within a MSA or an outer boundary of any city or town (over 20,000 population) which has experienced 150% unemployment rate of the national average. 

EB 5 investor can also request an area to be designated as TEA by presenting relevant publicly available government data at the time of petitioning USCIS.

## EB 5 visa processing time

Currently USCIS takes about 1-2 years to process an EB-5 petition. EB-5 processing time has been creeping higher because of the recent surge in the popularity of the EB-5 program.

About 10,000 EB-5 visas are available every year for foreign investors. While the demand for EB-5 investors was low in it's first 2 decades of existence, demand has been increasing since the turn of the decade. For the first time in 2014, all the 10,000 visas were secured by the investors. The demand is driven by Asian businessmen looking to immigrate to the U.S. The local industry is also helping the growth by creating projects in the regional centers to attract overseas investments.

## EB 5 regional centers

An EB-5 Regional Center is an economic unit designated by (USCIS), which allows government and private organizations to create investment pools. Regional Centers can then launch a new business or revive an existing business through the money in the investment pool. So, instead of individual investors launching a business on their own, they could simply become a participant in the business by contributing the money to the investment pool. Jobs created for the individual contribution are counted towards the requirements of applying the EB-5 visa. 
Regional centers typically build business like building casinos, apartments etc. Regional centers help the investors by reducing the burden of launching a business. They also help in meeting the job requirements under EB-5 program rules. It also helps Regional center project developers to raise money for the business initiatives. 

Another important advantage of Regional Center EB-5 petitioners are that they may meet the job creation requirements based on economic projections of either direct or indirect job creation.
But the EB-5 petitioners through new commercial enterprise can only count the directly created jobs for the the job creation requirement. 

Currently there are over 1000 USCIS approved [regional centers](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/immigrant-investor-regional-centers) spread across various states. 


Eb-5 regional centers which are also located in TEA areas are the most popular option by a large margin.

## EB 5 program steps

USCIS grants green cards to qualified EB 5 investor and the family members conditionally for a period of 2 years. This approval is granted on the evidence that the investor has already invested or actively in the process of investing in an EB 5 eligible investment. 
Approval also depends on the evidence which proves that the requisite employees have already been hired. If not a comprehensive business plan showing that at least 10 qualifying employees will be hired due to the nature of the commercial enterprise needs to be submitted. 

The investor can apply for removal of conditions before the completion of second year and obtain permanent residency. USCIS
approves this petitions based on evidence that the foreign investor has sustained the EB 5 qualified investment throughout the 2-year period of conditional permanent residence. It also hinges on evidence that the 10 full time jobs have already been created or will be created in a reasonable amount of time. 

## EB 5 risks

Even though USCIS approves EB-5 regional centers, it doesn't endorse the activities of the regional center. USCIS also doesn't eliminate risk to the investor or guarantee U.S. securities laws compliance. Several fraudulent activities have come to the fore in recent times.

Unlike other investments, the primary objective of EB 5 investments is securing a U.S. green card and in many cases the investors are located in a different country. Fraudulent businesses can take advantage of the situation and raise money from foreign investors by marketing as EB-5 qualifying investment opportunities. Such investors potentially could potentially lose their investments and the immigration petition as well.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stepped up the monitoring of EB 5 securities. However, SEC urged  investors to be cautious of fraudulent investment opportunities. So it's highly important for the foreign investors to do their own due diligence before making investment decisions. 

USCIS has recently stepped up it's audit efforts of the regional centers. And it periodically terminates regional centers which were approved earlier.
Such terminated regional centers are published on the USCIS  [website](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/permanent-workers/employment-based-immigration-fifth-preference-eb-5/eb-5-immigrant-investor-process/regional-center-terminations)
