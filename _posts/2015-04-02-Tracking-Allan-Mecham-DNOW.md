Allen Mecham recently bought DNOW in q3 and q4 of 2014 for a reported price of 30$ and 25$ respectively. Notable, this was even before the oil plunge.
While we may never know his investment thesis, I am trying to reverse engineer

National Oil Varco (NYSE: NOV) over the last decade has been very successful growing through acquisitions, a strategy adopted by its CEO Pete Miller.
NOV spun off its low margin distribution business as Distribution Now (NYSE:DNOW) in the summer of 2014.
Interestingly, post spin off Pete Miller moved on to the much smaller DNOW as its **Executive** Chairman.

In a fragmented oil distribution industry, MRC Global and DNOW control 24% and 18% market share respectively. Rest by other smaller companies.
 MRC itself was put together by Goldman Sachs by acquiring a couple of smaller companies in 2007.  Both MRC and DNOW seem to aim growth by consolidation.
 MRC with debt, has already been acquiring companies.

Possible thesis by Mecham,

1. Classic Special Situation:
May be a quality spin off which the market is yet to notice and hence undervalued.

2.  Economics:
Distribution is an asset light business. Also counter cyclical, in a downturn inventories and hence working capital needs shrink.
 This was confirmed in MRC's q4 call, when it stated to pay down debt with working capital savings. DNOW also has no debt.

3.  Expanding industry:
Shale revolution is driving higher investment in distribution and gathering systems.

4.  Expanding margin:
DNOW's margin expansion goals.

5. Management:
DNOW seems to have right management for the industry. They also have NOV like compensation structure where bonuses are tied to ROIC and TSR (Total stock holder return).

6. Valuation:
DNOW's income statement is cluttered so far because of spin off and also because of large scale SAP software roll out. May be Mecham was able to look through to locate value.

Many of the above is applicable to MRC as well. And note that the famous Sequioa fund has a small position in MRC.

Except price to book all other conventional metrics indicate an expensive stock (data from gurufocus.com).
Mecham bought the stock at a higher valuation than the data below.

Looking at 2013 that is before the one time spin off and SAP software expenses, per share EBIT is 2.09$. So at 30$ price, Mecham
seems to have approximately paid 15 times pre-tax income which seems to be a bit expensive to me.
Overall, positive business traits of DNOW may have attracted him to the stock.
But unsure of his valuation techniques.

#Looking ahead
In 2014 q4 conf call, the CEO Robert Workman stated that margin expansion might be delayed because of industry down turn.
He also added that whoever mocked at their offer 6 months ago are now calling back to renegotiate.
DNOW is lucky to be hunting when valuations are cheap.

On the other hand, during q4 call MRC's made it clear that it is laying off employees, freezing acquisitions etc., through the downturn.
Instead of being greedy, it is shutting shop.

Overall, While DNOW's seems to be in an advantageous position, its stock has fallen from 35$ to 21$ along with the industry.
If Mecham has seen value at 30$, at 21$ he should have loaded more, if not he might have decided to sell cutting down the losses.
Awaiting 2015 Q1 disclosure.
