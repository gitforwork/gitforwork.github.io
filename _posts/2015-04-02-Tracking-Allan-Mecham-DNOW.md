description: 'Tracking Allan Mecham DNOW'

Allen Mecham recently bought DNOW in q3 and q4 of 2014 for an avg price of x and y respectively. Notable, this was even before the oil plunge.
While we may never know his investment thesis, I am trying to reconstruct the possibilities.

National Oil Varco (NYSE: NOV) over the last decade has been very successful growing through acquisitions, a strategy shaped by its CEO Pete Miller.
NOV spun off its low margin distribution business as Distribution Now (NYSE:DNOW) in the summer of 2014.
Interestingly, post spin off Pete Miller moved on to the much smaller DNOW as an **Executive** Chairman.

In a fragmented oil distribution industry, MRC Global and DNOW control 24% and 18% market share respectively. Rest by others.
 MRC itself was put together by Goldman Sachs by acquiring a couple of smaller companies in 2007.  So its clear that both MRC and DNOW aim to grow by consolidation.
 MRC with debt, has already been acquiring companies. DNOW has same plans.

DNOW's EBITDA margin is a lowly 4%, and has stated its aiming for 8%. MRC is already in that range.

Possible thesis by Mecham,

1.  Special Situation:
May be a quality spin off which the market is yet to notice and hence undervalued.

2.  Company economics:
DNOW doesn't have large plants, generally leases warehouses and has asset light operations. Its also counter cyclical, in a downturn it shrinks its inventories and hence working capital.
 This was confirmed from MRC's q4 call, where it stated that during the down turn its going to pay down more debt. DNOW also has no debt.

3.  Expanding industry:
Shale revolution is driving higher investment in distribution and gathering systems.

4.  Expanding margin
DNOW's intent of margin expansion. However, because of industry down turn, the CEO stated that the expansion might be delayed.

5. Management
DNOW seems to have right management for the industry. They have NOV like compensation structure where bonuses are tied to ROIC and TSR (Total stock holder return).

6. Valuation
DNOW's income statement is cluttered so far because of spin off and also because of large scale SAP software roll out. May be Mecham was able to look through to locate value.

In my opinion most of the above is applicable to MRC as well. Note that the famous Sequioa fund has a small position in MRC.

#Looking ahead
In 2014 q4 conf call, the CEO Robert Workman stated that margin expansion might be delayed because of industry down turn. He also shared that companies who literally mocked at their acquisition offers 6 months
    ago are calling back to re negotiate. DNOW is looking to make disciplined acquisitions. I feel DNOW is lucky to be hunting when valuations are cheap.

On the other hand, during q4 call MRC's made clear that it is freezing acquisitions, hiring, laying off and focused on managing the debt and company through the downturn.
Instead of being greedy, it is shutting shop.

Overall, While DNOW's seems to be in an advantageous position, its stock has fallen from 35$ to 21$ along with the industry.
If Mecham sees the same way he could have averaged down, if not he might have decided to sell cutting down the losses.
Awaiting 2015 Q1 disclosure.
