Why Allen Mecham bought DNOW

DNOW is the low margin distribution service spin off from National Oil Varco (NOV). NOV is a popular stock.
So many people own DNOW as part of the spin off. However, Allen Mecham has bought DNOW from open market in q3 and q4 2014 for a avg price of x and y respectively even before the oil plunge.

What did he see in DNOW?
NOV's success in the last couple of decades has been through acquisitions helmed by Peter Miller. He is a well regarded ceo credited with the superior performance of NOV's acquisitive growth.
Interestingly post spin off he decided to move to DNOW which is much smaller than NOV. He also decided to become Executive chairman for DNOW participating actively in DNOW's strategy.

Oil distribution sector has been vastly fragmented. 24% controlled by MRC Global and 18% controlled by DNOW, rest by others. MRC itself was formed Goldman Sachs after acquiring a couple of distributes.  MRC has been expanding by acquiring companies in the space by adding on debt. For all intents and purposes DNOW is going to follow the same strategy.

Mecham might have seen this as a classic special situation investing with an active chairman known for acquisitive growth in a fragmented industry.
DNOW doesn't have large plants etc, its generally asset light.
DNOW also is counter cyclical, as down cycle hits it can easily shrink inventory and save on working capital.
North American shale revolution is creating lots of midstream and downstream investments, potentially benefiting DNOW.
Until Q4 results, DNOW's results were cluttered because of spin off and a major SAP software implementation expenses. Mecham might have noticed value through the clutter.

He might have chosen because of one or all of above reason or totally something else.

Besides his buy, I came across the following during Q4 calls,
Its more or less clear, that MRC and DNOW are competing to consolidate the fragmented energy distribution space. If that is the case the best time to buy is now when you can fold smaller players for cheap. But MRC because has lots of debt and because of it it has shut shop on the acquisition front. The ceo said their focus is to manage pay back the debt and manage the company conservatively until the downturn is over. On the other hand, DNOW was lucky to become a stand alone company right at the beginning of the oil downturn especially with no debt. DNOW mentioned in its Q4 call that smaller players who mocked at acquisition offers before the oil downturn are calling back to see if the offer still holds.
So DNOW is disciplined in acquisition like NOV and happens to be lucky.
