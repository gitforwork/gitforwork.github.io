###What is FOIA?
The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is a law that gives you the right to access information from the federal government.
So, people have been using FOIA to request their I140 documents. More information in [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States))

###Will my employer know about my I140 FOIA request to USCIS?
No. FOIA request is a private transaction between you and USCIS.

###My employer didn't share either my I140 case number or approval number. Is it still possible to apply?
Yes. It is possible to request I140 with just basic information like your passport number, latest I94 number etc.

###Will the document provided by USCIS sufficient to port my green card priority date or apply for H1b extensions?
Yes. USCIS sends a copy of I140 application with approval stamp which should be sufficient.
