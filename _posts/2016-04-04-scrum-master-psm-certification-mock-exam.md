description: Scrum Master PSM I certification mock exam
---
Recently my employer encouraged a group of us to get Scrum Master certification (PSM 1) from [scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/)
Once I obtained my certification (Yay), I prepared a mock exam to help my colleagues to pass the exam.
People appearing for the exam found this very useful and wanted to share with other friends.
So, I decided to post it online to make it easy for anyone preparing for the certification.
