USCIS has allowed certain H4 dependents employment authorization cards (EAD) to start their work. It's a fairly straight forward
process. Here is the checklist of documents required as anyone is preparing for applying their H4 EAD

- A payment for $380 (check USCIS site for latest fee) either money order or check (personal checks are ok) payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security

- Completed and signed I-765 Form

- Approved I-140 copy of the H1b spouse

- A copy of H4 passport and H4 visa

- H4 I-94 issued at port of entry ([lookup on DHS site](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search)) 

- A copy of H4 approval (I-797) including I-94 in it 

- Marriage certificate

- A copy of spouse H1B petition ( I-797 )

- A copy of spouse H1B I-94

- A copy of spouse H1B passport (first and last page)
