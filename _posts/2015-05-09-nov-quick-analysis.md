NOV seems to be a popular stock with investors. Quick post of my buying thesis/
NOV is primarily in the business of building variety offshore rigs. NOV doesn't seem to have direct competitors in its space.
Hence, NOV is cited to have built a dominant market share in its segment. At this point, because it has built
a large install base it has a good prospect for after market parts business. However, with offshore rig overcapacity,
profits are going to be shrinking in the next year or so before it starts improving. Shrink is due to the oil industry
downturn, nothing specific to NOV. NOV should be able to weather the storm for next 1-2 years,
and ready for upturn once the industry rebounds.

#Valuation
Since this is a cyclical industry I am taking the average of the last 10 years pretax earnings which include 2
downturns. That 10 year pretax earnings average: $2383

At current market cap of $20650, it sells for a pretax multiple of 8.66.
Less than 10, which is thought to be Buffet's hurdle rate.
Converting this to per share, I feel shares under $55 are worth buying. Obviously, lesser the better.

The current CEO was the COO for a long time and has contributed to NOV's success in the past.
As mentioned in the earlier post on DNOW, NOV's management incentives are aligned to share holders.
Also, NOV is one of the top 10 oil service provider in terms of return on capital.
NOV is a strong company and could come out much stronger.

Might give satisfactory returns if planning to hold this for 3-5 years or more.
