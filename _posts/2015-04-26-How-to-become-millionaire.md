Chuck Akre is a money manager, whom I recently started following. In most of his talks he talks about a
  hypothetical penny that doubles everyday for a month. What would you have at the end of the month?
  I tried this trick on myself and my friends. Nobody had a correct answer. What's more interesting,
   when the correct answer was revealed, people refused to believe. The correct answer is over 10 million dollars!
  Check out the you tube video of Chuck Akre at the bottom of the page.

  Human mind has difficulty grasping the power of compounding. So we need a short cut for a metal math. That short cut is
   "rule of 72". It essentially helps us estimate the time it takes to double the money for a given rate of return.
    For example,
    at 10% compounding 7 years to double initial investment.
    at 20% compounding 4 years to double initial investment.
I tend to remember the above because the 10% is the long term return of US stock market over a long term. Long term
    I infer from one of Chuck Akre's presentation, that's the US stock market return for more than a century.
And that 20% is the returns generated by Warren Buffett for over 50 years.

So, with these in mind, I wanted to see what it takes to become a millionaire. I wanted simple round numbers
to act as a north star in all my investment decisions.
 After trying out some numbers here,
http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm,
Starting with and adding 25K$ every year for 15 years makes you a millionaire. Rate assumed is 11% which is slightly above long
term market returns. But it gives nice round numbers to remember.
What if I magically get Warren Buffet's insight? (except, magics don't happen in real life!)
Starting with same 25k$ and adding 25k$ every year at 20% compounding makes a millionaire in 11 years.

So, in summary, 40000$ is what it takes to get to be a millionaire in 15 years at market returns.!
