DNOW's 2014 EBITDA is cloudy because of lots of one time expenses connected to the company's separation from NOV.
2013 EBITDA 241
2014 EBITDA 202
Avg:221.5, Here after referred to as just EBITDA

DNOW has $1b revolver. Let's assume they are able to deploy 3 times EBITDA of 664m in acquisitions in the next 2 years.
Its not unreasonable to assume acquisitions are made by paying 8 times EBITDA. This will fetch $83m add on EBITDA.
After 2 years, new EBITDA would be at $304m. That's a 17% CAGR. This assumes no margin improvements.
No organic growth/shrink.
No share dilution.

If the market values at the same multiple as of today that would also fetch us a return of 17%.
However, at $24.4 market values dnow at approx 12 times EBITDA. This rather seems high compared to private transaction
multiples. Assuming multiple comes down to 10, market cap comes to just over $3b.
To aim for atleast 15% CAGR over the next 2 years, today's market cap should be $2.3b. With 102m outstanding shares that's
 about 22.5$ per share.
How about at a more reasonable 9 times EBITDA multiple?
2 year mkt cap will be $2.7b. So today it has to be at $2.04b translating to 20$ per share.


will add 83m to the EBITDA of the whole company in the next 2 years.
New EBITDA is $304m.
So at 10 times the new EBITDA of 311 make the company worth $3.11 billions.
With current market cap at 2.64, that's close to 12% CAGR.

It has paid 8.7 times EBITDA for acquiring a Stream AS a Norway company in 2013

241 to 331 EBITDA in 2 years gives 17% CAGR.
Current EBITDA per share 2.25; Apply 17% CAGR for 2 years gives 3.08$.
Multiple  Value
11        33.88
9         27.72

At 20$ per share, potential 2 year compounded return will be a attractive 16%.
