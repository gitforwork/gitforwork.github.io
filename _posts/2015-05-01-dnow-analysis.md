DNOW's 2014 EBITDA is significantly less than 2013. 2014 revenue seems to have come in slightly less than 2013.
Annual report alludes to extra one time investments needed to function as a standalone company and also
one time major resource planning IT implementation investment. Since the management indicates these are one time investments,
I decided to take the mean of 2013 and 2014 EBITDA for rest of the valuation.
That average of $221m here after simply referred to just as EBITDA.

Lets change tracks a bit and look at some private value transactions in the past in this space.
Here is a [link](http://www.stockspinoffs.com/2013/10/25/national-oilwell-varco-distribute-distribution-business/)
about CE Franklin acquisition by NOV,

    May 2012 – the company acquired CE Franklin from Schlumberger (SLB) at a reported ~8.1x EBITDA and .4x Revenue.
    April 2012 – the company acquired Wilson International at .4x revenue

Another quick search lead me to DNOW's competitor, MRC's [10K](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1439095/000119312513466793/d640547d8k.htm)
about an acquisition of privately held Norwegian company,

    Stream’s 2014 EBITDA is expected to be approximately $30 million, and the acquisition purchase price reflects a
    multiple of 8.7 times estimated 2014 EBITDA.

This seemed to indicate that 8x EBITDA seems to be a common valuation multiple. This seems to be inline with multiples
used by rollups. DNOW has $1b revolver. Let's assume they are able to deploy 3 times EBITDA of 664m in
acquisitions in the next 2 years. At 8 times EBITDA, it will add $83m EBITDA by 2017. So, after 2 years, new EBITDA
would be at $304m. That's a 17% CAGR of EBITDA. This calculation assumes no margin improvements.
No organic growth/shrink either. And no share dilution considering the capital deployed is well below the revolver.

After 2 years,
If the market values at the same multiple as of today that would also fetch us a return of 17%.
However, at $24.4 market values dnow at approx 12 times EBITDA. This rather seems high compared to private transaction
multiples we have seen.

Assuming multiple comes down to 10, market cap would be just over $3b.
To aim for a 15% investment CAGR over the next 2 years, today's market cap should be $2.3b.
With 102m outstanding shares that's about 22.5$ per share.

Assuming multiple comes down to 9, market cap would be $2.7b.
To aim for the same 15% investment CAGR over the next 2 years, today's market cap should be $2.04b.
That translates to roughly 20$ per share.
