 OK, So you are an immigrant spouse and have finally obtained the H4 EAD card and ready to work. Congrats!
 And you may have started applying for jobs through the usual channels (aka Indeed, Dice, Monster, Linkedin, Linkup, Friend referrals).
 But if you haven't landed on that job yet, it is a good idea to complement your job hunt through the following less common avenues

### 0) Friend referrals, Indeed, Dice, Monster, Linkedin, Linkup
 OK, While this post is all about alternate avenues for job hunting, lets's make sure you extracted full value out of the usual options.

 * Friend referrals are the most effective way to land an interview call and in many cases that job. Are you sure that you have already explored all your friends and contacts who can refer a job? Make sure you follow up in a nice way if it has been a while since you last asked them. Try to expand the circle by asking for friends of friends. And if you have already worked before the break, contact your old managers to see if they have any open positions.

 * Like most people, if you have location constraints and are looking for jobs in only certain locations, make sure to include positions that allow remote work as well. Also, expand to include nearby cities if you can commute over the weekend etc.And it doesn't have to be permanent, you can give it a shot and meanwhile look in your city. It's easier to get another job if you already have one.

 * Even though you may want to work in a specific location, that doesn't mean you don't have to apply nationwide. Read on to find why,
	 There are several advantages in looking for jobs nationally,
	 While the companies may not be open to considering offering remote jobs at the beginning of the process,
	 they may be willing to consider once they have invested the time and effort and are willing to hiring you.
	 Even if not right away, they may be open to let you work remote after some time like 3 months.
	 Even otherwise, remember it's easy to get a job when you are already employed. So, you are better off looking for
	 a job in your city of preference when you are already employed elsewhere.
   Even if you didn't get a job that was flexible, it will atleast help with brushing up your interview skills. You can use these interviews to [smoothen the rough edges]({{ site.url }}posts/5-ways-to-answer-career-gaps-questions-for-H4-EAD-applicants/), so you are in top form when you land an interview for that dream job. So, don't confine yourself to your geographic preferences. Look beyond!

 * Similarly, don't be too fixated on the salary or experience level. For all of the reasons described earlier, consider going for jobs with slightly lower roles or lesser salary. Chances are that once you prove your performance, you could negotiate for a higher role or more salary or both, down the line.

* Also, consider going in adjacent fields. For example, if you are looking for a Business Analyst position, consider
   positions like Technical Writer or even Quality Analyst. Or if you were a programmer think about becoming a Scrum Master.
   You never know, you may like the new roles and that may open up new opportunities. After all, in a long career,
   people tend to take different roles and this may be an opportunity to do so. And it doesn't have to be always an adjacent career opportunity. If you had a desire to try totally different career, this may be a good time to try.



### 1) Craigslist
 Not many people know that Craigslist has a section for job advertisements.
 Companies advertise in Craigslist because the ads are cheaper and location speific.
 [For example, you can find plenty of Software Engineer jobs in the bay area](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?query=software&excats=&cat_id=23&cat_id=24&cat_id=48&cat_id=25&cat_id=12&cat_id=100&cat_id=57&cat_id=15&cat_id=129&cat_id=130&cat_id=61&cat_id=26&cat_id=54&cat_id=14&cat_id=47&cat_id=128&cat_id=13&cat_id=28&cat_id=127&cat_id=27&cat_id=49&cat_id=126&cat_id=75&cat_id=131&cat_id=59&cat_id=21&cat_id=50&cat_id=55&cat_id=125&cat_id=52&cat_id=11&cat_id=16&userid=&search_distance=&postal=)

### 2) StackOverflow Jobs
 While StackOverflow sites are known for Q & A, they also have a career section. Hence, it is a good idea to keep an eye on their job section

### 3) Career Fair
 Most cities have career fairs all around the year. Search online, to see if you have anything coming up. In addition, most big universities also have their own department specific career fairs. And many of them allow external candidates for a small fee. If you are early in your career or looking to restart after a long gap, this may be worth exploring this option.

### 4) Non-commercial employers
Most non-commercial sector like universities, state agencies, city administration jobs are not indexed by the job sites. And yes, many of them hire people on visa. So, it may be a good idea to look in their own sites, especially the universities. The jobs may be more steady and relaxed. In addition, [https://www.governmentjobs.com/](https://www.governmentjobs.com/) indexes government jobs.

### 5) AngelJobs.co
 Startups and early stage companies use this site to hire people. While the pay may be less or
 even non-existent, you may be offered equity in the company. On top of that, you get to be in a fast paced and
 dynamic environment. While not everyone can work in a startup environment, it's still a good opportunity to learn and quick growth.

### 6) redditt/forhire
 Reddit is a popular social book marking site. And lots of people hang out around their topics of interests.
 And reddit happens to have an active "for hire" thread.

### 7) Freelancing
 Beyond the conventional job market, there is a big parallel free lancing job market. With freelancing, you can look for
 jobs all around the world. Most of the freelancing jobs also come with greater job flexibility. While landing your
 initial gig may be challenging, once you get going things will become easy.
