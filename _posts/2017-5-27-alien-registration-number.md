## Alien registration number on H1b

Not all H1b visa holders have an assigned Alien number. USCIS assigns one, only after the person's permanent immigration petition is approved. Until then, Alien number cannot be obtained from your H1b documents. 

Alien number is printed on the H1B approval notice for an individual who has a previously approved I-140 application. Generally, USCIS assigns A# to a person after the person's permanent residency petition, such as I140 is approved. Any subsequent H1b extension, transfer approvals notices will contain the Alien registration number.  However, the Alien number obtained from the previous I140 approvals should have been included in the subsequent H1b applications to USCIS. Otherwise, it will not be automatically printed on the H1b approval notices. And H1b application receipt notices will not have it.

## Alien registration number on F1

F1 visa, like the H1b is not a permanent residency visa. Hence, there are no A-number assigned to a student. However,
it is assigned when the student applies for OPT EAD. The number is printed on the EAD card.

## Alien registration number on EAD
If you have a Employment Authorization Document (EAD), your A-number would be printed on the card. It may be called USCIS # on the card.
Typically, for students who are on F1 visa and who have obtained OPT work permit, this is an easy way to get their number.

## Alien registration number on I140

This is the most straight forward way to get your I140 approval notices. Alien number is assigned by USCIS on I140 petition approval. A# number will be printed on your I140 approval notice. 

## Alien registration number on Green Card

If you have a Green Card, your A-number will be printed on the card. Some old cards may have it printed on the back of the card, while most of the cards have it printed on the front.

## Ask USCIS Alien registration number 

If you are not able to find your USCIS number in your existing immigration documents, you can get it directly from USCIS through their [infopass appointment](https://my.uscis.gov/appointment). Since the USCIS number is personal and confidential information, USCIS does not share it over phone. So schedule an infopass appointment and be prepared to present your ID proof. Upon verification, USCIS will disclose your number. It's a free service from USCIS.


## Does A# appear in I-94?
No A# is not printed on the I-94. Not all immigrants have a USCIS#. And even for the ones that have one, it's not printed on the I-94.

Typically, USCIS assigns a A-number for immigrants applying for permanent residency (green card). It is also assigned in other situations like at the time of applying for employment authorization document (EAD). A-number is unique to an individual, hence, it's almost like a social security number for immigration. USCIS archives all the immigration applications and documents identified by the A-number of the individual. And the same can be obtained by filing a USCIS FOIA through the A-number.
