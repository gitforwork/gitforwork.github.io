Alien registration number is an unique 7-9 digit unique number assigned by USCIS to permanent immigrants of the U.S. It is also commonly referred to as "A-number" (A#) or USCIS number. 

## How do I find my alien registration number?

If you think you have a Alien registration number, you can obtain from your immigration documents like H1b, I140, Green card, EAD etc. If you don't have any of them then you can directly ask USCIS.

## Alien registration number on H1b Approval notices

Not all H1b visa holders have an assigned Alien registration number. USCIS assigns one only after the person's permanent immigration petition is approved. Until then Alien number cannot be obtained from your H1b documents. 

Alien number is printed on the H1B approval notice for an individual who has a previously approved I-140. Generally, USCIS assigns a A# to a person after the person's permanent residency petition, such as I140 is approved. Any subsequent H1b extension, transfer approvals notices will contain the Alien registration number.  However, the A# obtained from the previous I140 approvals should have been included in the subsequent H1b applications. Otherwise, it will not be automatically included in the H1b approval notices.

## Green Card

If you have a green card, your A-number will be printed on the card. Some old cards may have it printed on the back of the card, while most of the cards have it printed on the front.

## EAD 
If you have a Employment Authorization Document (EAD), your A-number would be printed on the card. It may be called USCIS # on the card.
Typically, for students who are on F1 visa and who have obtained OPT work permit, this is an easy way to get their number.

## USCIS Infopass appointment

If you are not able to find your USCIS# in your existing immigration documents, you can get it directly from USCIS through their [infopass appointment](https://my.uscis.gov/appointment). Since the alien registration number is personal and confidential information, USCIS does not share it over phone. So schedule an infopass appointment and be prepared to present your ID proof. Upon verification, USCIS will disclose your number. It's a free service from USCIS.


## F1 visa:

F1 visa, like the H1b is not a permanent residency visa. Hence, there are no A# assigned to a student. However,
it is assigned when the student applies for OPT EAD. The number is printed on the EAD card.

## Does A# appear in I-94?
No A# is not printed on the I-94. Not all immigrants have a USCIS#. And even for the ones that have one, it's not printed on the I-94.

Typically, USCIS assigns a A-number for immigrants applying for permanent residency (green card). It is also assigned in other situations like at the time of applying for employment authorization document (EAD). A-number is unique to an individual, hence, it's almost like a social security number for immigration. USCIS archives all the immigration applications and documents identified by the A-number of the individual. And the same can be obtained by filing a USCIS FOIA through the A-number.
