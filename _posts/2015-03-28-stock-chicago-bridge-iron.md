Spoiler alert: This is a very lazy buy! Not much of analysis went into buying and you will see why.
Chicago Bridge and Iron (CBI) is over a 100 year old engineering construction company. It undertakes complex engineering projects like thermal,
nuclear power plants, refineries etc.

Its currently available for a trailing p/e around 8. Why is it cheap?
Well, Lightning struck the stock twice last year.

The first one started with an acquisition,
Two years ago CBI purchased a nuclear construction company called Shaw group. One of a nuclear power plant projects undertaken by Shaw group
is running late in schedule, thereby leading to a law suit. There is uncertainty around the outcome of the lawsuit. This did not seem to affect the stock much.
However, on the heels of the acquisition, a little known firm called Perscient capital published a short thesis. In spring of 2014, when it was first
published, the report alluded to using accounting tricks to shore up the company's prospects. It concluded that the real value of the company is only 37$
and not the near 90$ it was trading at the time. In the next few months, market responded and cbi plunged to about 60$.
This was followed by one of the big crude price slide that started in fall of 2014.

Recently revived new technologies managed to extract oil and gas out of US shale rocks.
This started the North American shale revolution which contributed significantly to worlds oil and gas production. However, there was one problem,
world did not need as much of oil and gas. This sudden oversupply lead to lower natural gas production starting from 2011 and  lower oil price starting
in fall 2014. A barrel of oil fell from over 100$ in Aug 2014 to about 50$ by Jan 2015. What's interesting, just a 1% over supply of oil lead to almost
 50% drop in oil prices in a space of 6 months. Oil took down the whole oil industry along with it. This included CBI which is involved in constructing
 refineries and converting coal power plants to nat.gas plants. By the end of Jan 2015 when it was trading at around 39$, I stumbled upon CBI.

I came looking to the oil rubble to find a few cheap companies. Need less to say I am bullish on oil recovery. Furthermore, CBI isn't directly exposed to oil.
 Only 12% of its revenue comes from energy exposure. That means oil concern is an opportunity. But accounting irregularity is the elephant in the room.
 Here is the twist, Berkshire opened a position somewhere before the short thesis. And subsequently after the release of short thesis, they loaded up more.
 People speculate, this is not a Warren Buffet buy, but one of his managers, nevertheless its a strong statement against the short thesis. Then, I noticed another
  important information that David Einhorn has opened in a stake in Q42014. He is a investor known for his due diligence on company accounts.
  You don't need any more endorsements. But as an icing on the cake, the original short thesis alluded to a fair value of 37$. With current stock price at $39
  its close to their fair value estimate. It appeared a no-brainer to me. I did not even feel the need to look at the income statements or balance sheets.
  With the shale boom, US coal plants are getting converted to nat.gas. Nuclear plants are decommissioned. The abundance of nat.gas has triggered export
  facilities construction along the gulf coast. Refineries along the gulf coast are equipped to handle north american light crude. All these are
  open new opportunities for CBI. With accounting and valuation not a concern, David Einhorn and Berkshire (9.9% stake) have voted with their money.
  Shale revolution appears to be an ally and not an enemy to CBI.

  Opened a position at 41.63$ on Feb 17 2015 for a time horizon of 5 years.



US with a small % of world population is a voracious consumer of world's oil. And it goes about touting
  its lifestyle to other parts of the world, that other countries aspire to match US including India and China. This is driving mankind to go deep
  into forests, poles, and ocean causing ecological damage to quench this oil thirst. This is the long term trend. The shale revolution induced 1% over supply
  is nothing compared to the long term trend. So I believe oil and oil industry will recover

Around that time, Berkshire started a position in CBI at around 80$.
In Spring on 2014, a little known firm published a short thesis, which revolved around accounting irregularities in Shaw acquisition.
That story estimated the stocks real value to be around 37$. The stock cratered to around 60$ in the subsequent months.
However, in the following quarterly disclosure it became public that Berkshire bought even more after  the short thesis was published.
Clearly Berkshire is not concerned about claims of accounting irregularities by the short seller. In fact Berkshire owns about 10% of outstanding stocks. Though a Berkshire position, some people guess this may not be Buffett’s position but one of his money managers.

The second part of the stock slide is tied to energy. As oil price slid in late 2014, it brought down everything remotely related to energy. Since CBI has some energy exposure, it went all the way down to 32$ at one point. 90$ to 32$ in a matter of 8 months because of short thesis and oil price. When I became aware of the stock in Feb 2015, it was trading around 39$. A quick glance led me to believe that the company is not directly ties to oil as much as market thinks. In fact it occurred to me it’s a beneficiary of north American shale revolution as it benefits from many power stations converting to gas from coal. And other construction opportunities involved in exporting cheap natural gas and refinery constructions in the gulf coast. Continuing my research, I noticed David Einhorn, a well-known hedge fund manager has started a small position as of December 2014 at about average price of 50$.  That’s was a turning point as he is known for his in depth analysis of a company’s accounting.

With my general belief that low oil price may not be bad for the company, the only concern is the short thesis. With Berkshire voting against the short thesis with their money for the last 2 years, and David einhorn doing the same at 50$, accounting was no more a concern for me. On top of it, the short thesis estimated the stock’s worth to be at 37$ and read in the internet that fund has closed its short position. With current price slightly at 39$ its close to the fair price estimate of the short thesis even if it turns out to be true.
So this appeared to be a no brainer to me, so I opened a position in the stock
