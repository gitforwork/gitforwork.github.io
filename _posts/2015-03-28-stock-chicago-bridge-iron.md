Spoiler alert: No number crunching, A very lazy buy! You will see why.

Chicago Bridge and Iron (CBI) is over a 100 year old engineering construction company. It undertakes complex engineering projects like thermal,
nuclear power plants, refineries etc.

Its currently available for a trailing p/e around 8. Why is it cheap? Well, for 2 reasons.

The first one started with an acquisition,
Two years ago CBI purchased a nuclear construction company called Shaw group. One of the nuclear power plant projects undertaken by Shaw group in Georgia
is running late, which has lead to a law suit. There is uncertainty around the outcome of the lawsuit. But this did not seem to affect the stock much.

However, on the heels of the acquisition in Spring 2014, a little known firm called 'Prescience Point' published a report on how the
company uses creative acquisition accounting to conceal losses, resulting in GAAP financial statements divorced from its economic realities. A short thesis.
It calculated the real value of the company's stock at 37$ and not the near 90$ market value. Market responded and CBI plunged to about 60$.
At this time the second issue took hold. Big crude oil price slide that started in fall 2014.

As world was looking for new sources of oil, new technologies helped to extract more oil and gas out of North American shale rocks.
This started the North American shale revolution which contributed significantly to worlds oil and gas production. However, there was one problem,
 supply has grown so much that the world did not need as much oil and gas. This oversupply first lead to lower natural gas prices in 2011 and now
  oil price started falling in 2014.

  In fact, a barrel of oil fell from over 100$ in Aug 2014 to about 50$ by Jan 2015. What's interesting,
  just a 1% over supply of oil lead to almost 50% drop in oil prices in a space of 6 months. Oil took down the whole oil industry along with it.
  This included CBI which is involved in energy related construction projects. By the end of Jan 2015 when I first stumbled upon CBI,
   it was trading at around 39$.

I came looking to the oil rubble to find bargains. Need less to say I am bullish on oil recovery. Furthermore, CBI isn't directly exposed to oil.
 Only 12% of its revenue comes from energy exposure (which was later confirmed in the Q4 conf call). That means plunge created by oil oversupply is an opportunity.
 But accounting irregularity is still the elephant in the room.
 But interestingly I noticed that, Berkshire had opened a position somewhere before the short report was published.
 And subsequently after the release of short thesis, they loaded up more. People speculate that this is not a direct Warren Buffet buy, but one of his managers.
 Nevertheless its a strong vote of confidence (9.9% of the company as of Q4 2014).

  At the same time, David Einhorn, known for his due diligence on accounting has also taken a position in Q4 2014.
  You don't need any more endorsements against accounting concerns. But as an icing on the cake, the current stock price of 39$ is almost close to the
   short thesis fair value estimate of 37$. 39$ is also much lesser that the avg price paid by Berkshire and Einhorn.

  At this point, it appeared CBI is a no-brainer to me. I did not even feel the need to look at the income statements or balance sheets.
  With the shale boom, US coal plants are getting converted to NatGas. Nuclear plants are decommissioned. NatGas export
  facilities are being constructed along the US Gulf coast. Gulf coast refineries are upgraded to handle the North American light crude.
  All these are  potential new opportunities to CBI. Shale revolution appears to be an ally and not an enemy to CBI.

 Promptly opened a position at 41.63$ on Feb 17 2015 for a time horizon of 5 years or longer.
