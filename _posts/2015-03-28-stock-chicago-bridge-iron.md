Spoiler alert: This is a very lazy buy! Not much of analysis went into buying and you will see why.
Chicago Bridge and Iron (CBI) is over a 100 year old engineering construction company. It undertakes complex engineering projects like thermal,
nuclear power plants, refineries etc.

Its currently available for a trailing p/e around 8. Why is it cheap?
Well, Lightning struck the stock twice last year.

The first one started with an acquisition,
Two years ago CBI purchased a nuclear construction company called Shaw group. One of a nuclear power plant projects undertaken by Shaw group
is running late in schedule, thereby leading to a law suit. There is uncertainty around the outcome of the lawsuit. This did not seem to affect the stock much.
However, on the heels of the acquisition, a little known firm called Perscient capital published a short thesis. In spring of 2014, when it was first
published, the report alluded to using accounting tricks to shore up the company's prospects. It concluded that the real value of the company is only 37$
and not the near 90$ it was trading at the time. In the next few months, market responded and cbi plunged to about 60$.
This was followed by one of the big crude price slide that started in fall of 2014.

Recently revived new technologies managed to extract oil and gas out of US shale rocks.
This started the North American shale revolution which contributed significantly to worlds oil and gas production. However, there was one problem,
world did not need as much of oil and gas. This sudden oversupply lead to lower natural gas production starting from 2011 and  lower oil price starting
in fall 2014. A barrel of oil fell from over 100$ in Aug 2014 to about 50$ by Jan 2015. What's interesting, just a 1% over supply of oil lead to almost
 50% drop in oil prices in a space of 6 months. Oil took down the whole oil industry along with it. This included CBI which is involved in constructing
 refineries and converting coal power plants to nat.gas plants. By the end of Jan 2015 when it was trading at around 39$, I stumbled upon CBI.

I came looking to the oil rubble to find a few cheap companies. Need less to say I am bullish on oil recovery. Furthermore, CBI isn't directly exposed to oil.
 Only 12% of its revenue comes from energy exposure. That means oil concern is an opportunity. But accounting irregularity is the elephant in the room.
 Here is the twist, Berkshire opened a position somewhere before the short thesis. And subsequently after the release of short thesis, they loaded up more.
 People speculate, this is not a Warren Buffet buy, but one of his managers, nevertheless its a strong statement against the short thesis. Then, I noticed another
  important information that David Einhorn has opened in a stake in Q42014. He is a investor known for his due diligence on company accounts.
  You don't need any more endorsements. But as an icing on the cake, the original short thesis alluded to a fair value of 37$. With current stock price at $39
  its close to their fair value estimate. It appeared a no-brainer to me. I did not even feel the need to look at the income statements or balance sheets.
  With the shale boom, US coal plants are getting converted to nat.gas. Nuclear plants are decommissioned. The abundance of nat.gas has triggered export
  facilities construction along the gulf coast. Refineries along the gulf coast are equipped to handle north american light crude. All these are
  open new opportunities for CBI. With accounting and valuation not a concern, David Einhorn and Berkshire (9.9% stake) have voted with their money.
  Shale revolution appears to be an ally and not an enemy to CBI.

  Opened a position at 41.63$ on Feb 17 2015 for a time horizon of 5 years.
