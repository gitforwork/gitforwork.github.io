description: Comparison of H1b and L1 visa programs
---
Both H1b visa and L1 visa programs are to bring certain skilled temporary workers to the US, though H1b is arguably the popular one in the media. L1 visa may be less popular in the media, but it is definitely popular with the employers. Consider the fact that dependents of a L1 visa can also work from day one. If you make a reasonable assumtion that 1 in 4 L1 dependents (L2 visas) enter work force, I would argue that every year, L1 visa program enables more immigrants to work in the US than the H1b visa.
Here is the plot of L1 vs H1b over the years,

The graph is plotted using publicly released USCIS date. Note that, it assumes 1 in 4 dependents work. Combined that with the L1 primary visa holder it outnumbers even the H1b program in 5 out of the last 7 years.

Anyways, moving on to the actual differences between the two programs,

attribute  | H1b    | L1
-------------  ------     ------
Yearly Cap | 85000 |No cap
Minimum wage|Must pay at least the minimum prevailing wage in the market|No minimum
Duration| 6 years | 5-7 Years
Education| US bachelors or equivalent matching the area of work|No minimum education required, as long as the worker has certain special skill
Dependents work permit | Not allowed | Spouses are allowed to work from day one
Blanket petition|Not allowed. Each worker's petition must be individually approved | Companies can get certain number of petitions approved as a blanket and flexible to bring any temporary worker as needed using the blanket category. No need to apply to USCIS for each individual case, saving processing times
Permanent residency| Employers must conduct a labor market test to hire a US citizen and then the worker has to wait his turn in the queue according to his/her country of birth | L1A workers can apply in Eb1C category, which requires 
no US labor market test. Usually can get green card under a year

It looks to me in every category above, L1 is more flexible than the H1b visa.
