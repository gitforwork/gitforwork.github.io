  In the Indian epic Mahabaratham, a warrior called Abhimanyu learns how to enter a form of circular sword fight, but
  not how to finish or come out of it. His limited knowledge kills him in the war, because he doesn't know to finish the
  circular sword fight, once after he enters it.

  Similarly, value investing texts heavily focus on how to enter a stock, but not so much on how to sustain and exit.
  But those are as important as entering a position in a stock.  Typically value purchases are contrarian buys and
  it can become a lonely and difficult position to hold on.
  Hence, I want to establish some guiding principles for investment success.

  ##Sustain
  
  ###Market
  Mr.Market as a manic depressive guy, is a very helpful mental construct to navigate market fluctuations.
  But this mental construct can also terribly mislead you. Its very important to remember that Mr.Market is mostly
  a sane guy. Only rarely does he become irrational, typically in the extreme positive and negative situations.
  So its helpful to remember Mr.Market as "everyday rational, occasionally irrational" guy.

  Its important to learn that highs and lows are part of normal investing activity. Buffett has said something to the effect
  of people are not suited for investing, if they cannot withstand 50% market declines.
  Quoting Peter Lynch to close the section,

      "If you go to Minnesota in January, you should know that it's gonna be cold.
      You don't panic when the thermometer falls below zero."

      "You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen,
      then you're not ready, you won't do well in the markets."

  ###Volatality
  Buying a stock below its intrinsic value doesn't mean the stock goes straight up after purchase. The stock might
  deteriorate sharply, despite the underlying business intact. Roger Loweinstein book about Buffett mentions an incident.
  Somewhere in the 70s/80s, the stocks he bought after a large market decline, declined further 50% in the next 2 years.
  Yet, Buffett isn't worried, he goes around trying to find money to buy even more. Couple of Peter Lynch quotes to
  sum up the section,

        "The real key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them.
        If you go to Minnesota in January, you should know that it's gonna be cold. You don't panic when the thermometer
        falls below zero.

  ###Timing
  Stock prices zig and zag and it may be tempting to indulge in swing trades. But that's hardly a sustainably way to profit
  in the long run. It means only 2 abilities; impeccable prediction and timing, which by the way no human has mastered.
  Buffett explained that he invested in Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crises immediately when he found value,
  though he may have got it cheaper if he had waited longer. Again Peter Lynch wisdom to round up the
  section(emphasis mine),

      "But my system for over 30 years has been this: When stocks are attractive, you buy them.
      *Sure, they can go lower.* I've bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30."

  ##Exit
  Finally, when should one exit a stock? This depends on individual investing styles.
  Compounders, Moaty Businesses, Net asset purchases each may have different rules to sell or not to sell.
  Its helpful to define rules and follow them. Ben Graham has suggested selling at 50% gain or 2 years whichever is earlier.
  This can be tweaked to suit investing styles, but important to have them and stick to such rules to leave emotions
  out of the door.
