IT service is primarily in the business of developing custom software for the enterprise.
Money is made by renting the time of its software engineers to its customers. They do this primarily in 2 ways,
1) Embed person directly into a customers team and charge a fixed rate per hour for the service
2) Deliver an entire project to the customer with 100% of its employees. Mostly on a fixed price on the project.
There are some hybrids between the 2 models as well.

Custom software is developed and maintained to improve the productivity and competitiveness of an organization.
Constant technology obsolesce is a plus for IT service firms, as it translates to constant need for its software engineers.
IT service business has good long term staying power, as technology is expected to become more pervasive.

This industry has no barrier to entry evidenced by the numerous IT consulting firms of all sizes.
The biggest cost of operation is employee salary. Its important to pay fair market rate to retain employees. Here is where
India based IT companies have a advantage. Because they have access to talent at cheaper price.
The growth of many Indian IT service companies like TCS, Wipro, HCL prove that fact. Cognizant even though is based out of US,
it has its vast majority of operations in India.

Though the industry has no barriers to entry, most companies seem to not engage in destructive price wars. The industry as a
whole seem to be value creating for the investors.
Why should it be that way?
The biggest operational expense is employee salary. Free market ensures similar costs to all the players.
No company can expect to have sustainable cost savings by salary reduction.
Hence, probably each firm seem to be content maintaining their target margin.

Now on to cognizant (CTSH). It has compounded book value at 30% for the past 10 years and 20% in the past 5 years.
Growth seems to have slowed a bit. But I think it may have stabilized around 15-20%.
This 15-20% can come from gaining more market share, gaining higher value work in US. It still has potential market share
opportunities outside Europe. Furthermore, it can do acquisitions as it has done in recent past.
Finally, its business consulting side seems to be small but with traction.

Valuation,
Current trailing PE of 22 seems to be in within the range the company has traded in last few years.
And it seems to be fair price.

Bought CTSH @54.04 on 12/05/2014.
