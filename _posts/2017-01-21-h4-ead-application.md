## H4 EAD Eligibility

Principal H1b non-immigrant should be a primary beneficiary of an approved Form I-140 Immigration petition. H4 dependent spouses of such individuals are eligible to apply for EAD. 

Even if you are currently not on H4 visa, but planning to change the status from other visa types you may be eligible. For example, H1 to H4 EAD applications can be concurrently applied. Similarly, USCIS also allows concurrent filing of F1 to H4 EAD change of status. 

## H4 EAD premium processing
H4 EAD application doesn't have premium processing on it's own. But, if your primary H1b spouse is due for H1b extension, then H4 EAD can also be included with that application. If such H1b extension petitions are upgraded to premium processing, then as a courtesy USCIS also approves EAD within the premium time frame. 

## H4 EAD Application fee
$410 as of January 2017 (It used to be $380 earlier). Check the latest [USCIS filing fees](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/our-fees)
Make a cashier's check or personal check, payable to "US Department of Homeland Security". No online payments are available at this point.

## H4 EAD form I-765
You would have to fill the [form I-765](http://www.uscis.gov/i-765) for requesting EAD. Make sure all the information are clear and correct. Importantly, the H4 applicant should sign the form. It's a good idea to keep a copy of the completed form for own records. 

USCIS also offers a service to notify you electronically (email, text), when your form I-765 is accepted at their facility. This is an optional service. But if you want to use it then you would have to include the completed form [G-1145](http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/g-1145.pdf).

#### Pay attention
To avoid unnecessary delays, make sure the form is signed. And it should also be accompanied by the correct fee. USCIS will reject the application in either case. And you will have to refile with the issues fixed.
