description: H1b visa 2018 lottery. Predictions from Department of Labor (DOL) data
---
H1b visa season for fiscal year 2018, cap will begin on April 1st 2017. Labor Condition Application (LCA) data from Department of Labor (DOL) already indicates this is going to be a high demand year. Here are the important details.

- [H1b 2018 cap](#h1b-2018-cap)
- [H1b 2018 predictions](#h1b-2018-predictions)
- [H1b visa 2018 lottery date](#h1b-visa-2018-lottery-date)
- [H1b 2018 and Trump](#h1b-2018-and-trump)

## H1b 2018 cap
General cap: 65,000: Master's cap: 20,000

For many years, the H1b cap is fixed at 65,000 visas. In addition, students who studied in the U.S. (masters and above) will have an exclusive 20,000 visas. Remember, students who didn't get picked up for masters quota will then get a second chance with the general 65,000 visas. 

## H1b 2018 predictions

For the last 3 years there has been an overwhelming demand for the 85,000 visas available. Filing LCA is the first step before applying for the actual H1b petition. LCA data for this year indicates that 2018 is going to have a lottery just like the last 2 years.
At this point LCA data indicates, 

> Around 230,000 new H1b petitions can be expected. So, 3 out of 5 H1b applicants are going to be unlucky

Following is the LCA data (updated frequently),

2015 and 2016 H1b lottery involved 230,000 and 236,000 petitions respectively. The above graph compares the LCAs decisions announced by DOL by March 3rd of the respective years. As you can see above, 2018 LCAs are roughly inline with the last 2 years. Hence, if the 2018 numbers continue to trend like the last 2 years, the projection for final H1b petitions is around 230,000 petitions. As data becomes available for the upcoming weeks, the projections might change. With H1b under lots of uncertainty, Employers may increase the number of petitions to make best use of the visas as they are available. But so far data doesn't show any increase. But, we will keep monitoring the data. 

For comparable data from the last few years. In the last few years the cap is reached within the first week. Before that it has taken longer. Typically a random lottery is held by USCIS if the cap is reached in the first week.
Here is the detail about more historical petitions.

## H1b visa 2018 lottery date
In the past years USCIS accepts H1b visa petitions for the first week. At the end of the first week, USCIS stops accepting any new visa petitions. 
It also announces the number of petitions received and proceeds to perform a randomized computer lottery. This year is not going to be any different. 
Hence, missing the April 2017 deadline means, Employers will not be able to participate in the 2018 lottery. 

## H1b 2018 and Trump
Summary: Nothing to worry this year. 
H1b is under news for the last 2 years, primarily fueled by the election year. Specially, since President Trump took over the administration there has been significant attention on the H1b visa program.
There has been flurry of bills introduced in congress this year. But the bills are in early stages and they have to undergo a long process before it becomes a bill.

Here is a quick summary of the bills introduced so far,

##### Minimum $130,000 salary
- This bill as not as bad as it is made to look like. 
-  Minimum $130,000 salary is not for everyone, but only for H1b dependent employers. H1b dependent employers are the ones who have at least 15% of their work force on H1b. 
- Even for the H1b dependent employers, it's not the end of the world, employers have to file additional paper work to hire people less than the $130,000.
 
#### Minimum $100,000 salary bill
- This bill proposes to increase the minimum salary of H1b positions to $100,000 a year. It's not clear if the minimum salary will be adjusted according to the location

#### Stricter H1b and L1 visa bill
- This bill proposes to redefine the qualifications for the H1b and L1 visa programs. This bills aims to put in place checks and balances so that it rewards candidates with better education, high skills and high salary. 
   
#### Trump's executive orders. 
There were rumors that President Trump will issue an executive order around the H1b program. However, in the recent weeks the rumors have died down. Recently in his speech in Congress, he called for introducing a Merit based immigration program. But not much details are available about it and it can take many years to put in place. More importantly for such total sweep of the program, Congress has to act. President cannot act unilaterally to achieve this.

#### Efforts from India
India has been traditionally a high user of the H1b visa program. So, with all the news going around about H1b, India has naturally initiated diplomatic contacts with the U.S. around the program. The out come of it will not be known until later.

The bottom line is that all these bills are not going to affect this years H1b. This is going to be another high demand year.
