description: H1b visa 2018 lottery. Predictions from Department of Labor (DOL) data
---
USCIS will begin accepting petitions for the H1b visa 2018 season by April 1st 2017. We track the Labor Condition Application (LCA) data from Department of Labor (DOL). It already indicates this year is going to be another high demand year and hence lottery. Here are the important details.

- [H1b 2018 cap](#h1b-2018-cap)
- [H1b 2018 predictions](#h1b-2018-predictions)
- [H1b visa 2018 lottery date](#h1b-visa-2018-lottery-date)
- [H1b 2018 updates](#h1b-2018-updates)
- [H1b 2018 and Trump](#h1b-2018-and-trump)

## H1b 2018 cap
>> General cap: 65,000; Master's cap: 20,000

Students who studied in the U.S. (Masters degree and above) are eligible for the 20,000 master's cap. Everybody else will be qualified for the general 65,000 category.

## H1b 2018 predictions

For the last 3 years there has been an overwhelming demand for the 85,000 visas available. Filing LCA is the first step before applying for the actual H1b petition. LCA data for this year indicates that 2018 is going to have a lottery. And just like the last 2 years the demand is going to overwhelming. At this point LCA data indicates, 

> Around 230,000 new H1b petitions can be expected this year. So approximately, 3 out of 5 H1b applicants will be rejected

Following is the tracked [LCA data](https://lcr-pjr.doleta.gov/index.cfm?event=ehLCJRExternal.dspAdvCertSearch) (updated frequently),

Applications | 2016 | 2017 | 2018 | 2018 projection
---------- | ------ | ------|-------
Total H1b petitions | 230,000 | 236,000 |  | 230,000 
Number of LCA decisions made as of March 3rd | 54,995 | 53,322 | 54,706 | 230,000

2015 and 2016 H1b lottery involved 230,000 and 236,000 petitions respectively. The above graph compares the LCAs decisions announced by DOL by March 3rd of the respective years. As you can see above, 2018 LCAs are roughly inline with the last 2 years. Hence, if the 2018 numbers continue to trend like the last 2 years, the projection for final H1b petitions is around 230,000 petitions. As more data becomes available in the upcoming weeks, the projections might change. With H1b under lots of uncertainty, Employers may increase the number of petitions to make best use of the visas this year. But, so far data doesn't show any increase. But, we will keep monitoring the data and update frequently

##### Notes:
- Single LCA may be used to apply for multiple H1b petitions. For the purposes of the prediction, that data is not included
- For simplicity, prediction doesn't separate out the lotteries for master's and general cap 

In the last few years the cap is reached within the first week. Before that it has taken longer time of reach the cap. In those years there will not be a H1b lottery. Typically a random lottery is held by USCIS if the cap is reached within the first week.
Here is more historical details about the petitions and time it took to reach the cap,

## H1b visa 2018 lottery date
In the past years USCIS accepts H1b visa petitions for the first week. At the end of the first week, USCIS stops accepting any new visa petitions. USCIS also announces the number of petitions received and proceeds to perform a randomized computer lottery. The lottery has happened in the second week of April. This year is not going to be any different. USCIS will announce the lottery information.

Little bit about the lottery process if you are new to the game. If the number of petitions received by USCIS exceeds the 20,000 cap then all those petitions are included in random lottery just for the 20,000 cap. Those who did not get selected in that lottery is then grouped with rest of the applications for the lottery for the next 65,000 visas. So, Masters students get 2 chances. 

Either ways, first week of April is important deadline and the petitions from the employers have to reach USCIS by then. Otherwise, the petitions will not be included for the H1b lottery. 

USCIS rejects and returns the petitions that are not selected in the lottery along with the H1b fee paid.

## H1b 2018 updates
- 3/3/2017 : Latest LCA are updated and H1b lottery projections updated
- 3/4/2017 : USCIS [suspended premium processing of H1b applications] (https://www.uscis.gov/news/alerts/uscis-will-temporarily-suspend-premium-processing-all-h-1b-petitions)
USCIS reasons that it is to clear the long pending H1b extensions, amendments etc. This also means new H1b petitions for the FY 2018 H1b cap cannot be applied in premium processing. This may be minore inconvenience if you were planning to apply in premium.
It could also be an indication that USCIS is expecting lots of new H1b petitions. Hence this suspension of premium processing for 6 months could be part of the plan to handle the load. 

- 3/4/2017 : Another [new H1b reform bill](http://indianexpress.com/article/world/bipartisan-h1b-l1-visa-reform-bill-introduced-in-us-congress-4553802/) was introduced. This bill is just in early stages, and hence this year H1b will not be affected.

## H1b 2018 and Trump
Summary: Nothing to worry this year. 
H1b is under news for the last 2 years, primarily fueled by the election year. Specially, since President Trump took over the administration there has been significant attention on the H1b visa program.
There has been flurry of bills introduced in congress this year. But the bills are in early stages and they have to undergo a long process before it becomes a bill.

Here is a quick summary of the bills introduced so far,

##### Minimum $130,000 salary
- This bill as not as bad as it is made to look like. 
-  Minimum $130,000 salary is not for everyone, but only for H1b dependent employers. H1b dependent employers are the ones who have at least 15% of their work force on H1b. 
- Even for the H1b dependent employers, it's not the end of the world, employers have to file additional paper work to hire people less than the $130,000.
 
#### Minimum $100,000 salary bill
- This bill proposes to increase the minimum salary of H1b positions to $100,000 a year. It's not clear if the minimum salary will be adjusted according to the location

#### Stricter H1b and L1 visa bill
- This bill proposes to redefine the qualifications for the H1b and L1 visa programs. This bills aims to put in place checks and balances so that it rewards candidates with better education, high skills and high salary. 
   
#### Trump's executive orders. 
There were rumors that President Trump will issue an executive order around the H1b program. However, in the recent weeks the rumors have died down. Recently in his speech in Congress, he called for introducing a Merit based immigration program. But not much details are available about it and it can take many years to put in place. More importantly for such total sweep of the program, Congress has to act. President cannot act unilaterally to achieve this.

#### Efforts from India
India has been traditionally a high user of the H1b visa program. So, with all the news going around about H1b, India has naturally initiated diplomatic contacts with the U.S. around the program. The out come of it will not be known until later.

The bottom line is that all these bills are not going to affect this years H1b. This is going to be another high demand year.
