description: Frequently asked questions while applying SSN by H4 EAD recipients
---

You may have obtained your H4 EAD and getting ready to work. But before that you would have to
apply for your Social Security Number (SSN). Because, your employer would need it for adding you to their payroll,
doing back ground verification etc. Here is a list of frequently asked questions while applying for SSN.

### I already had a SSN when I used to work when I was in a different visa. Do I still need to apply?
No, social security number is issues to an individual generally once. Hence if you already have one, start using it.
You don't have to apply again for the same.

### What are the documents needed? And what is the procedure?
You will need your SSN application form, Passport, ID Proof, EAD card, and a print-out of your I-94 from the CBP website.
And follow the [procedure described on the SSA site](http://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/).

### When filling the form, what do you select for the question 5, Legal Alien allowed to work vs Other?
If you are in H4 EAD status, choose Legal alien allowed to work

### I have a ITIN number, can I keep it while I receive my SSN?
You have to rescind your ITIN after you get your SSN. Your past tax documents filed using your ITIN number has to be
associated to the new SSN number. You can send a letter to IRS, that you have a new SSN and you would like to associate the
the previous tax records to your new SSN. And also attach a copy of the SSN card. [Get more help from IRS site](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Additional-ITIN-Information).

### My EAD card has not arrived. Can I use the EAD approval notice to apply for SSN?
No. For the purpose of applying SSN, you would need the EAD card. You cannot apply with just the approval notice.

### I got an H4 EAD with incorrect details. Can apply for SSN with this card?
Unfortunately, you can't apply for SSN. SSA office will not accept cards with typos. You first have to get it corrected on the
EAD card. While you can start looking for jobs, you cannot apply for SSN until the information is corrected.
You can check with USCIS on how to correct the information. If you are in a hurry try to raise an expedited SR request.

### Do I need to work if I get a SSN? Does my tax filing status change because of SSN?
No for both. You don't have to work if you get your SSN. But if you already have ITIN, you have to rescind that by contacting
IRS. And in general, your tax filing status do not change because of SSN. You can continue to file jointly if that's what you
 have been doing.

### Should we notify DMV about the change from ITIN to SSN?
Yes if you have a state ID card or a drivers license without SSN, you can contact the DMV and update your SSN.
DMV may ask you to bring Passport, your new SSN etc.

### Do we need to get an Employment letter from a employer to apply SSN?
Not needed. Job is not a criteria for applying for SSN. So, you can apply for SSN whether you plan to work or not.
 It may be a good idea to apply for SSN before landing a job as the employer would ask for SSN and you can avoid
  unnecessary delays.

### My EAD has a future effective date, can I apply for SSN before that date?
No you cannot. You can apply only when you have a valid EAD card. If the card becomes active in a future date,
then you would have to wait until the start date.

### The agent at SSA office told me that she cannot verify my EAD details and that she needs more time to verify. What can be done?
 This is a common scenario. You don't have to worry about it. USCIS maintains a database of approved EAD applicants. And there
 may be a lag in updating the database. If SSA office cannot find your information in the SAVE database then they may
 ask for more time to wait for verifying your details. SSA agent would basically post your information to USCIS for verification.
 While you are waiting for the verification, you can [check the status of your case](https://save.uscis.gov/casecheck/SearchCases.aspx).
 It may take anywhere between 2-4 weeks or more. Should there be a prolonged wait, you can try calling USCIS to get the status.
 Once the status of your case on the SAVE website changes from "Under review" to "returned to the agency", you can expect your
 SSN shortly (1-2 weeks). But if there is further delay, you can check with your local SSA office.
 If they say they haven't received any update from USCIS, you can mention that you spoke
 with USCIS (http://www.uscis.gov/save/contact-save) and that they will not divulge any information
 to the application and instead wants the agency to call them directly on the toll free number (in the contact SAVE
 website). Alternatively, some people have found success by taking a print out of the SAVE status page and show them.
 Remember to make all information available to the SSA agent and be courteous.
 The whole process might take 4 weeks.

I received my EAD card a month and half ago and I recently went to the SSA office to apply for SSN#.
The SSA officer told me that the application did not go through and therefore
he needs to post the documents to DHS for their approval
(which sounds similar to what happened with several cases shared by others in this forum).
I have a job offer (which I like) and my employer asked for my SSN#.
I am concerned that the employer may not wait if getting my SSN is delayed by a long time.
I checked the "SAVE Case Check" website and could see that my case is currently under review.

I am wondering why my application did not go through at the SSA office given that I waited for one and
half months after receiving my EAD card. I am also wondering if there is any way to expedite
the process of getting the DHS approval and SS card. Also, is there a phone number for
DHS/USCIS for obtaining help/information in this regard?

Any suggestions/help will be greatly appreciated.

I applied for my SSN today but the officer told me that her system does not show any info about me so
she has to send it to another agency (USCIS?) to verify my info and that would take
10 days and after that they will issue SSN. The whole process might take up to 4 weeks.
Is it normal for such a process to happen?
I am a bit confused about the purpose of this link -- https://save.uscis.gov/casecheck/
Is this the link for tracking of my SSN application? Please advise.

using save casecheck you can track enquiry status from ssa to dhs/uscis.
once case status changes to return to agency i believe then you can call and ask ssa about the ssn.
----------------
My suggestions (just based on my personal experience!): After the SAVE check status changes
to "returned to the agency," you should call the SSA and inform them that the SAVE check status changed.
If they say they haven't received any update from USCIS, you can mention that you spoke
with USCIS (http://www.uscis.gov/save/contact-save) and that they will not divulge any information
 to the application and instead wants the agency to call them directly on the toll free number
 (in the contact SAVE website). The USCISC guy that I spoke with actually suggest that I go to the
 SSA and have the agent call their toll free number to find out whats happening.
  In my case, the agent probably called USCIS because he did receive an
  update saying the documents could not verified, but I feel there is no harm in asking the agent to call USCIS
  if a few days have passed from the time SAVE check status changes.
  The bottom line is that it is only the SSA that can push USCIS.

Hey all..

I need to thank everyone for posting ur experiences n especially sivakumar for his excellent suggestion.

I got my H4 EAD on Nov 17'2015 after waiting for around 6 months. When I visited SSN office,
the lady officer has told me that verification was not completed and it would take 4-6 weeks for the process.
I came back home and searched blogs to find out if anyone faced the same problem.
I found that many were having the same issue but no one suggested how to proceed further.

Post from sivakumar on nov 30'2015 helped me a lot and I checked my status on SAVE and it indicated that
 DHS verified my case on Nov 17th' 2015 itself. I took the copy of that to SSN office and asked them
 if they have any update about my case. Initially, they told me that I need to wait for another 2-4 weeks.
 When I showed her the copy from the SAVE website, she verified my information again and confirmed me that
 I would get my SSN within a week.

I feel that as soon as DHS updates, SSN database doesn't get updated automatically.

As suggested by sivakumar, it's better to go to SSN office in person with a copy from SAVE website
(status indicating "RETURNED TO AGENCY") to expedite ur SSN application.
