process. Here is the checklist of documents required as anyone is preparing for applying their H4 EAD

- A payment for $380 (check USCIS site for latest fee) either money order or check (personal checks are ok) payable to U.S. Department of Homeland Security

- Completed and signed I-765 Form

- A copy of passport including H4 visa stamped page

- H4 I-94 issued at port of entry ([lookup on DHS site](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/recent-search))

- A copy of H4 approval (I-797) including I-94 in it

- Marriage certificate
