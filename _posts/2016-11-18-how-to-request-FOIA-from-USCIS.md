One aspect of the US immigration system is it's complex. And like many areas of law there are many nuances. Occasionally,
 you may run into situation where you don't have access to your own immigration documents or your employer is not
 willing to sharing them. That could be your documents related to your visas or your green card or others.

 And luckily, US has a law called Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) which gives you right of access to your documents within the branches of government.
 And most agencies for government come under this including U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). USCIS is one of the 3 immigration agencies and it holds number of important information about an immigrant. To help you
 obtain your documents, USCIS has a well defined process on how to make a FOIA request.

 But, before you prepare your FOIA requests, make sure you are using the FOIA for the right purposes and the
 type of documents you are requesting is maintained by USCIS. USCIS is generally the records keeper of immigrations
 applications for visas, green card applications etc. Port of entry details are maintained by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
 And FOIA cannot be used to ask for status of your pending USCIS immigration applications. And it cannot be used to get original documents either.
 FOIA also has [exemptions](http://www.dhs.gov/xfoia/gc_1208265747435.shtm). For example, documents pertaining to national security concerns cannot be released.

 With the basics of USCIS FOIA out of the way, Let's see how to make the application.

need for filling the form.

petitions like H1b I-129, I-140, I-130. etc

make it easy to identify the information you are requesting.

 your immigration documents.

### How long does USCIS take to respond?
 USCIS follows a three-track system. How sooner USCIS processes your request depends on the complexity of the document requested.
 USCIS maintains a "A-file" or Alien-file with all information pertaining to your immigration history.
 If you request for the complete A-File it most likely go into track 3 and might take several months to a year or even more.
 But if you are requesting selected documents with the A-file like your green card petition or H1b petition
 documents, most likely those will go into the simple track. At the time of writing this simple track takes about a month to process.
 Anything between the two is slotted in the middle track.
