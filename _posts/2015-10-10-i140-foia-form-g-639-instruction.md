---

[Check FAQ](/posts/request-i140-via-foia/) of this blog gives an overview of FOIA.
This post contains information about how to fill the form [G-639](http://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/g-639.pdf).

### The form asks to give the purpose? Can I skip it?
Yes. It's not required
* * *
### The form asks for a A-number? What is it?
 Alien number (A#) is a number USCIS uniquely assigns to you after your I140 is approved. This number is carried all the way through
 to your green card. If you have obtained a visa extension with approved I140, your I797 should have the A-number.
 This is not the same as labour/PERM number (example: A-xxxxx-xxxxx).

 People have indicated this is also not the same A# printed on the OPT EAD cards for people who studied in the US.
 However, A-# is not a mandatory item. Doesn't hurt to have though.

### Is it mandatory to get the FOIA application notarized?
No. You can also choose "Sign under perjury". It's up to you to decide.

### Where do I send the documents?
You can either send using an email or a normal mail.
