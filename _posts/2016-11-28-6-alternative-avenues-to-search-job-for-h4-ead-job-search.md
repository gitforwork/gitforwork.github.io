 OK, So you are an immigrant spouse and have finally obtained the H4 EAD card and ready to work. Congrats!
 And you have started applying for jobs through the usual channels (aka Indeed, Dice, Monster, Linkedin, Linkup, Friend referrals).
 But, it is a good idea to complement your job hunt through the following lesser known avenues.

### 0) Indeed, Dice, Monster, Linkedin, Linkup, references
 OK, While this post is all about alternate avenues for job hunting, did you fully explore the usual options?
 Let's first get that covered,

 * If you are looking for jobs in certain locations, make sure to look for remote jobs as well.
 * Even though you may want to work in a specific location, that doesn't mean you don't have to apply nationwide.
	 There are several advantages in looking for jobs nationally,
	 While the companies may not be open to considering offering remote jobs at the beginning of the process,
	 they may be willing to consider once when they have invested time and closer to hiring you.
	 Even if not right away, they may be open to let you work remote after some time like 3 months.
	 Even otherwise, remember it's easy to get a job when you are already employed. So, you are better off looking for
	 a job in your city of preference when you are already employed. Even if you didn't land a job,
	 you could still use the interviews as practising opportunities. Because, when you get that interview call from
	 your desired job, you will not be too rusty. So, don't confine yourself to your geographic preferences. Look beyond.
 * Similarly, don't be fixated on the salary or experience level. For all of the reasons above, consider going for jobs a level lesser than you have already done or for salary slightly lesser.
	 Chances are that once they realize you perform better than your role, you could negotiate for a higher role or more salary or both down the line.
 * Also, consider going in adjacent fields. For example, if you are looking for a Business Analyst position, consider
   positions like Technical writer or even Quality Analyst. Or if you were a programmer think about becoming a Scrum Master.
   You never know, you may like the new roles and they may open up other opportunities. After all, in a long career,
   people tend to take different roles and this may be an opportunity to do so. And it doesn't have to be always an adjacent career opportunity. If you had a desire to try something else,
   this may be a good time to try.
 * And finally, Are you sure that you have already explored all your friends and contacts to look for referral jobs? Referral is the easiest way to get a foot on the door. Try to expand the circle by asking for friends of friends. Don't be too shy.

### 1) Craigslist
 Craigslist is not only used for local commerce, it's also used to advertise job positions as well.
 Companies advertise in Craigslist because the ads are cheaper.
 [For example, you can find plenty of ads for Software Engineer jobs in the bay area](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/jjj?query=software&excats=&cat_id=23&cat_id=24&cat_id=48&cat_id=25&cat_id=12&cat_id=100&cat_id=57&cat_id=15&cat_id=129&cat_id=130&cat_id=61&cat_id=26&cat_id=54&cat_id=14&cat_id=47&cat_id=128&cat_id=13&cat_id=28&cat_id=127&cat_id=27&cat_id=49&cat_id=126&cat_id=75&cat_id=131&cat_id=59&cat_id=21&cat_id=50&cat_id=55&cat_id=125&cat_id=52&cat_id=11&cat_id=16&userid=&search_distance=&postal=)

### 2) StackOverflow Jobs
 While StackOverflow sites are known for Q & A, they also have a career section. Hence, it is a good idea to keep an eye on their job section

### 3) Career Fair
 Most cities have career fairs all around the year. Go out and explore. In addition, many big universities in your locality also have their own department specific
 career fairs. And many of them allow external candidates for a small fee. If you are early in your career or looking to restart after a long gap, this may be worth exploring this option.

### 4) AngelJobs.co
 A lots of startups are looking for people who can do more than a conventional jos. While the pay may be less or
 even non-existent, you may be offered equity in the organization. On top of that you may get to be in a fast paced and
 dynamic environment. While not everyone can work in a startup environment, it's still a good opportunity to learn and perform.

### 6) Freelancing
 Beyond the conventional job market, there is a big parallel free lancing job market. With freelancing, you can look for
 jobs all around the world. Most of the freelancing jobs also come with greater job flexibility. While landing your
 initial gig may be challenging, once you get going things will become easy.
