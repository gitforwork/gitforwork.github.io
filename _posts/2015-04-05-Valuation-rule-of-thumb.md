On an average US stock market has returned 10% over a long arc of time.
We also know on a similar long arc of time, a stock's return track the underlying business returns.
At 15% returns, it takes 6.66 years to get back the original invested money.
At 10% returns, it takes 10 years to get back the original invested money.

if my rule of thumb is 10 times pretax earnings for a company, then I expect to recover my original investment in 10 years.
Different businesses have different rate of returns.
If a business earns a rate of return of 50%, then it is expected to return the original investment in 2 years. rest is just pure profit.
 If I am the seller, will I be willing to part with my business that's going to return the investment in 2 years? nope.
 At a minimum, I expect to get the money I will earn in 10 years, which is same as 10 times.
 To adjust for that, the price would be

Lets say 250$ is the EBIT.
At 10 times earnings, the value of the business is 2500$ ie if the business internally returns at 10%.
What if the business returns at 25%? so if you paid the same 10 times earnings of 2500$ in 10 years the business will generate
about 6250$. If I am the seller then I expect to receive at least 6250$. That's about 25 times today's earnings.

What happens at 30%? 2500$ would produce 750$ EBIT. 10 year earnings is 7500$. That's about 30 times earnings.
What happens at 5%? 2500$ would produce 750$ EBIT. 10 year earnings is 7500$. That's about 30 times earnings.

I want to double the principal within 10 years non-compounded.
p*n*(r/100) = p; if r is 30% and n=10
0.3*10

You want to pay upto 10 times ebit for a business that earns atleast 10% roic. So worst case you expect to make the
money back in 10 years.
