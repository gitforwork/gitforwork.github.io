description: Comparison of H1b and L1 visa
---
Both H1b visa and L1 visa programs are to bring certain skilled temporary workers to the US, though H1b is arguably the popular one in the 
media. L1 visa may be less popular in the media, but it is definitely popular with the employers. 
Consider the fact that dependents of a L1 visa can also work from day one. If you make a reasonable assumtion that 1 in 4 L1 
dependents (L2 visas) enter work force, I would argue L1 visa program enables more immigrants to work in the US  workers than the H1b visa i .


The above graph plots the data released by USCIS. It assumes 1 in 4 dependents work;combined with the L1 primary visa holder
it outnumbers even the H1b program in 5 out of the last 7 years. Who would of thought about that?

Anyways, moving on to the actual differences,

attribute  | H1b    | L1
-------------  ------     ------
Yearly Cap | 85000 |No cap
Minimum wage|Must pay at least the minimum prevailing wage in the market|No minimum
Duration| 6 years | 5-7 Years
Education| US bachelors or equivalent matching the area of work|No minimum education required, as long as the worker has certain special skill
Dependents work permit | Not allowed | Spouses are allowed to work from day one
Blanket petition|Not allowed. Each worker's petition must be individually approved | Companies can get certain number of petitions approved as a blanket and flexible to bring any temporary worker as needed using the blanket category. No need to apply to USCIS for each individual case, saving processing times
Permanent residency| Employers must conduct a labor market test to hire a US citizen and then the worker has to wait his turn in the queue according to his/her country of birth | L1A workers can apply in Eb1C category, which requires 
no US labor market test. Usually can get green card under a year

It looks to me in every category above, L1 is more flexible than the H1b visa.
