description: What are the options one has after H1b extension petition is denied
---
Recently, my friend got into an unfortunate situation where is H1b extension petition was denied after it went to a RFE.
It was denied because of not able to adequetly establish the project details at the third party client location at which he was placed
by his employer. Intially, it went into RFE which was replied to. However, USCIS was not satisfied and denied his extension.

Naturally, he had lots of questions like
- What are the next options available to him in terms of his visa? 
- Does he have to leave the country?
- If yes how soon does he have to leave the country?

This post is a guide to people who get into this unfortunate situation. 

#### Do I need to stop working? 
You can work until your previous I-94 date or until you recieve the hard notice of denial from USCIS. Most likely,
the notice might ask you to leave as soon as possible.

#### What happens to my status? Should I leave the country?
Your are technically out of status as soon as you or your employer receives the hard copy of the denial notice. 
Most likely, the notice might ask you to leave as soon as possible. Though you are out of status, you can take some time to
wind up your activities and plan for leaving. But remember you would be accruing unlawful stay, so plan to leave in a reasonable time 
frame. In my case, my friend left the country in 2 weeks.

#### What are the options available to revive my H1b visa?
There are few options depending on your circumstances
- Appeal the decision
  Your employer can opt to appeal the decision made by USCIS. But appleaing doesn't give you any legal status to stay and work.
  Also, appeals are not gauranteed to overturn the decisions and they generally do not. On top of if it may tahe several months to
  get a response for the appeal
